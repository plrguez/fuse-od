2020-12-05 Fuse 1.5.4 OpenDingux/RetroFW v0.0.5

    * Fixed wrong calculations of dirty blocks for the border scalings.

    * Fixed Pal TV Filter segfaults when border scaling is in use.

    * Beta OpenDingux new options:
      * General GCW0:
        · 'Adjust screen refresh rate' (default disabled).
        · 'Dynamic sound rate' (default disabled).

      'Adjust screen refresh rate'. Set the screen refresh rate depending
      on selected machine:
        · 60Hz for Spectrum 48K NTSC and Timex TS2068 models
        · 50Hz for all other models

      'Dynamic sound rate' adjust the rate used in the blip buffer to
      create sound samples to avoid sound pops.
      This is based on byuu/Near's article "Dynamic Rate Control".

2020-11-01 Fuse 1.5.4 OpenDingux/RetroFW v0.0.4

    * This release is mainly to build for the beta OpenDingux firmware based on
      kernel 5.10 and a few small bugfixes.
      No new features have been added.

    * Build for mainline OpenDingux beta firmware. Previous buils do not work
      in beta firmware becouse they are linked to libpng14 and new firmware
      provide only libpng16.

    * Fixed some warnings for GCC 10
      There are still some warnings for the upstream Fuse.

    * In beta firmware the driver do not list video modes other than native
      resolutions. Becouse of this the 320x240 and 640x480 resolutions are
      added when needed to allow change resolution to 320x240 on RG350M and
      to 640x480 on GCW0, RG350(P), RG280M. Those are needed for filters.

    * Change from Power button to Select button to close menu.
      In beta firmware Power button is sending various push events. The effect
      is that when menu is opened with Power button then it closes inmediately.
      In file dialogs Select is used to change from file filter to show all and
      Select will not close menu.

    * In beta firmware disabling triple buffer does not freeze the screen so
      the logic to flip pages is not applied in beta firmware.

    * Border scaling no longer updates the full screen and uses dirty blocks,
      just like Fuse is designed.

    * In the Joysticks options, the extension of the mapping files is not
      displayed to save space.

    * Screenshot fixes.  In version v0.0.3 status line info was changed to use a
      transparent overlay. With this change the ZX Spectrum screen under the
      overlay is marked as dirty and set to 0xff. If a border is used to
      scale the screen and a screenshot is taken, the overlay block appear as
      white block in the screenshot.
      Now the block of overlay screen is saved before mark it as dirty and is
      restored previous to screenshot saving.
