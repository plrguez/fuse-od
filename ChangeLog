2021-01-09 Fuse 1.5.4 OpenDingux/RetroFW v0.0.6

    * OpenDingux beta. Fixed L3 & R3 mappings.

    * Added Exit option to main menu

    * Circular navigation in menus and selection widgets

    * In options entries for numbers (as savestate slot) left and right
      cursors can be used to increase and decrease values.

    * Savestates:
       * Main features:
        · Up to 100 savestates per game
        · Savestates formats: SZX, Z80. Default and recommended is SZX.
        · Savestates per machine model. Enabled by default.
        · Savestate screen preview in savestates widget selectors.

      * Hotkeys assigned for savestates:
        · L1 + Cursor down    Quicksave state for current slot
        · R1 + Cursor up      Quickload state for current slot
        · R1 + Cursor right   Increase slot to use
        · R1 + Cursor left    Decrease slot to use

       * The Savestates functionality is a layer for quickly saving and loading
         snapshots organized by machine models and program names.
         Internally it uses the main functionality of Fuse to read and write
         snapshots. Becouse the main objective is speed up the operation to read
         and write snapshots for the use with handelds the options for
         savestates has been put directly in the main menú and assigned to new
         kotkey combos.

      * The Z80 format does not support all combinations for storing information
        about the media and hardware used, this include same machine models.
        Some examples:
          · Pentagon 256 and 1024 are saved as Pentagon 128, so when you save
            a savestate with this models the load change to Pentagon 128. If you
            are using savestates per machine model then the path to access
            savestates also change.
          · If you are using interface 2 with cartridge this information is lost
            when saved so the load of savestates will fail.
        For a tipical media as tapes and disks with no extra hardware attached to
        emulator you can go ahead with Z80 format, but for best cominations of
        hardware and media it's best to stick with SZX format.

      * The savestates location is:
          $HOME/.fuse/savestates/<MODEL>/<PROGRAM NAME>
          $HOME/.fuse/savestates/<PROGRAM NAME> if disabled per machine model

        · <MODEL> is the name for machine model as informed by libspectrum.
        · <PROGRAM NAME> is the name of the program with an attempt to remove
          any info about side/disk/part.
        · The name for the savestate will be the slot number with the extension
          for the selected format.

      * By default the savestates uses different locations for every machine
        model. This behaviour can be changed but that can lead to strange
        situations.
        For example with savestates per machine model disabled:
        · load a program for a 48k model
        · Create a savestate
        · Change the model to +2A and load the same program
        · Load the savestate and then the model is changed to 48k model.

      * For mediums with various parts (disk and tape sides) the emulator tries
        to determine a name for the saves removing this info, so the savestates
        for different sides/disks belong to the same program.
        An example of use is when you load a program and then save an state when
        you are side2/disk2. Later, in another session, you can directly load
        this state without load side1/tape1. Directly insert the medium for
        side2/disk2 and load the savestate from menú options or hotkeys combos.
        If necessary for tapes you can use the tape browser to position in the
        right phase/position to load.

      * The slot number for savestates is global. If you load another program
        without exit the emulator, the slot in use for the savestates of the
        newly loaded program is the one previously used.

2020-12-05 Fuse 1.5.4 OpenDingux/RetroFW v0.0.5

    * Fixed wrong calculations of dirty blocks for the border scalings.

    * Fixed Pal TV Filter segfaults when border scaling is in use.

    * Beta OpenDingux new options:
      * General GCW0:
        · 'Adjust screen refresh rate' (default disabled).
        · 'Dynamic sound rate' (default disabled).

      'Adjust screen refresh rate'. Set the screen refresh rate depending
      on selected machine:
        · 60Hz for Spectrum 48K NTSC and Timex TS2068 models
        · 50Hz for all other models

      'Dynamic sound rate' adjust the rate used in the blip buffer to
      create sound samples to avoid sound pops.
      This is based on byuu/Near's article "Dynamic Rate Control".
      See byuu/Near's article in https://byuu.net/audio/dynamic-rate-control/

2020-11-01 Fuse 1.5.4 OpenDingux/RetroFW v0.0.4

    * This release is mainly to build for the beta OpenDingux firmware based on
      kernel 5.10 and a few small bugfixes.
      No new features have been added.

    * Build for mainline OpenDingux beta firmware. Previous buils do not work
      in beta firmware becouse they are linked to libpng14 and new firmware
      provide only libpng16.

    * Fixed some warnings for GCC 10
      There are still some warnings for the upstream Fuse.

    * In beta firmware the driver do not list video modes other than native
      resolutions. Becouse of this the 320x240 and 640x480 resolutions are
      added when needed to allow change resolution to 320x240 on RG350M and
      to 640x480 on GCW0, RG350(P), RG280M. Those are needed for filters.

    * Change from Power button to Select button to close menu.
      In beta firmware Power button is sending various push events. The effect
      is that when menu is opened with Power button then it closes inmediately.
      In file dialogs Select is used to change from file filter to show all and
      Select will not close menu.

    * In beta firmware disabling triple buffer does not freeze the screen so
      the logic to flip pages is not applied in beta firmware.

    * Border scaling no longer updates the full screen and uses dirty blocks,
      just like Fuse is designed.

    * In the Joysticks options, the extension of the mapping files is not
      displayed to save space.

    * Screenshot fixes.  In version v0.0.3 status line info was changed to use a
      transparent overlay. With this change the ZX Spectrum screen under the
      overlay is marked as dirty and set to 0xff. If a border is used to
      scale the screen and a screenshot is taken, the overlay block appear as
      white block in the screenshot.
      Now the block of overlay screen is saved before mark it as dirty and is
      restored previous to screenshot saving.

2020-10-13 Fuse 1.5.4 OpenDingux/RetroFW v0.0.3

    * Rebase the source to the latest officcial commits for Fuse and libspectrum

    * New options:
      * Sound:
        · 'Sound frequency' (default 44100)

      * General GCW0:
        · 'GCW0 keyboard: Map LStick to DPad' (default enabled).
        · 'Border' (default Full)).
        · 'Panel type' (default 320x240).
        · 'Show status bar with border' (default enabled).
        · 'GCW0 keyboard: Map LStick to DPad' (default enabled)

    * Sound frequency option is now visible in Options/Sound menu.

    * Border option is for scale the main screen reducing the border size.
      · The scale is hardware (IPU scaling).
      · Full, Large, Medium, Small and None options available.
      · Scaling do not work for RetroFW 1.
      · For RG350M(640x480) and RG280M(480x320) the corresponding panel must be
        selected to make all border options scaling properly with 1x filters.
      · For RG280M(480x320) integer scaling is automatically deactivated with 1x
        filters.
      · Hotkey combo L1+R1+A assigned to switch between Full and None border.
      · Added an option to enable status bar with other border than Full.

    * Added a new option to make posible left stick use as directional pad when
      mapping is active for GCW0 keyboard. Until now left stick can only be used
      with GCW0 keyboard 1.

    * Increased buffer sound frames with triple buffer or border scaling.

    * For Timex models the 2x filters has been removed becouse never will work.

    * Some minor changes to fix vkeyboard display with some filters and models.
