Using the Fuse emulator
=======================

This port of Fuse to OpenDingux and RetroFW is a compilation of Fuse 1.5.7 for Opendingux/RetroFW
with some additions to the SDL UI and some new options.

So the thanks for this port are for Phillip Kendall and all the Fuse team.
And also to the GCW0/OpenDingux and RetroFW community for all documentation, development threads, and
all opensource ports.

At the end of this doc is the man page of Fuse 1.5.7 for a complete reference.

------------------------
### Opening the Menu ###
------------------------

You can open the menu with the `Power` or `Select` button.

If `Select` button is mapped to joystick or keyboard then the only option to open menu will be `Power` button.

---------------------
### Save settings ###
---------------------

By default the emulator don't save settings changes. You can save settings at any time from menu: `Menu -> Options -> Save`.

You also can activate "Auto-save" to save settings when you exit the emulator.

|To activate auto-save access to `Menu -> Options -> General` and check 'Auto-save settings'.
|Check the option with the `X` button and accept options with the `A` button.
|You should exit from the emulator or use the 'Save' to save this changes.

In this port the options are saved into 'fuse.cfg' file in the fuse config path.
If some option changes prevent to open the emulator delete this file and try to start again.

The config path is in '$HOME/.fuse' directory. If it does not exist the emulator will create it at start.
|$HOME is located in '/media/data/local/home' for OpenDingux and in '/home/retrofw' for RetroFW.

------------------------
### Virtual Keyboard ###
------------------------

Press the `Start` button to open a Virtual Keyboard when you are at emulator.

The keys in keyboard correspond to ZX Spectrum 48k keys.
When you press them are send to emulator as if you are using a real ZX Spectrum keyboard.

  `Cursor`    Move to select keys.
  `A`         Press selected key.

  `B`         Lock key. It's marked in blue.
              The locked keys are used when press the `A` button over a Key and then are unlocked.
              For use in combinations of Caps Shift or Symbol Shift with other keys.
              For example: In 48k mode you can Lock key "Ss" and then press 'Cs' key to change keyboard to "Extended" mode.

  `X`         Sticky key. It's marked in Red.
              The key is continously pressed.
              For example: In 48k mode you can press key 'J' then Sticky key 'Ss' and then press twice key 'P' to obtain 'LOAD ""'.

  `Y`         Clean all Lock and Sticky keys.
  `Start`     Close Virtual Keyboard

  `L1`, `R1`  Change the Virtual Keyboard position.
              There are 4 positions, one for earch corner of screen.

-------------------------------------
### Buttons at different contexts ###
-------------------------------------

=>Some machines don't have Sticks or `L2`, `R2` buttons.

Buttons in emulator:
--------------------

The buttons function detailed are when no mapping is assigned.

  `Cursor`    Shifted cursor ZX Spectrum keys (5, 6, 7 and 8 keys)
              This is modified by the setting "Use shift with arrow keys"

  `A`, `B`    Symbol Shift
  `Y`         CAPS Shift
  `X`         Space

  `Select`, `Power`
              Open Menu

  `Start`     Open/Close the virtual keyboard

  `L1`        If hotkey combos disabled: Nothing
              If hotkey combos enabled: Start a hotkey combo

  `R1`        If hotkey combos disabled: Caps Shith + 0 (DELETE)
              If hotkey combos enabled: Start a hotkey combo

  `Left Stick`
              Nothing.
              On some systems you can map it as cursor.

  `Right Stick`
              Nothing.
              On some systems you can enable an emulated mouse that uses the left
              stick to move the mouse. In Fuse you can use it as Kempston mouse.
              |In RG350 you can enable it with `Power`+`B` hotkey.

  `L2`        Nothing.
              Left click with mouse emulation enabled.

  `R2`        Nothing.
              Right click with mouse emulation enabled.


Buttons in Menu:
----------------

These are no dependent of button mapping.

  `Cursor`, `Left Stick`
             Move

  `A`        Select the option or accept the options at form
  `B`        Cancel and go back to previous menu or to the emulator if there is no previous menu

  `X`        At different contexts:
               - Mark/Unmark for check options: For example at General options -> Auto-save settings
               - Open list of options for list options: For example at Sound options -> AY stereo separation
               - It open 'enter name' dialog for file save dialogs.

  `L1`       Go to the first menu option
  `R1`       Go to the last menu option
  `L2`       In the file selector go to the first entry in the current directory
  `R2`       In the file selector go to the last entry in the current directory
  `Power`    Cancel and exit completely from any level of menu to the emulator

  `Y`, `Select`, `Start`, `L2`, `R3`, `Right Stick`
             Nothing

#### Maintain options ####
--------------------------
Some menu options open a form with options to check/uncheck or choose option from a list.

  - To check/uncheck options use `X` button.
  - To confirm changes in form use the `A` button.
  - To cancel changes in form use the `B` or `Power` buttons.

Some examples of forms are General, Media and Sound.

#### Virtual keyboard in menu options ####
------------------------------------------

In some menu options the virtual keyboard is presented to allow to use different options presented or enter values.

Examples where the virtual keyboard it's appearing are: 'Enter name' for save dialogs, Debugger, Poke Finder, Poke Memory.

  `Cursor`   Move to select keys
  `A`        Press the selected key
  `X`        Change the keyboard mode between upper and lower case and some additional characters
  `Y`        Delete previous character
  `B`        Cancel and exit to previous option in menu

  Confirm input
             To confirm the input press 'En' key at virtual Keyboard

|For the 'Enter the name' in save dialogs the last loaded filename without the extension is proposed.

------------------------------------------------
### Mapping buttons to Joysticks or Keyboard ###
------------------------------------------------

You can map handheld buttons to Joysticks or Spectrum keys in `Menu -> Options -> Joysticks`

==== GCW0 Joystick 1 ====
This option allows to emulate a ZX Spectrum joystick with the handheld buttons.
It also allows you to assign keyboard keys to buttons

  - Type: Choose the Joystick to emulate or None. Default is None.
  - Button mapping: Map the handheld buttons to Joystick fire, ZX Spectrum keys or to Nothing.

  Some type of Joysticks may require other emulator options enabled.
  |For example for Kempston joystick emulation you need to enable 'Kempston joystick'
  |in `Menu --> Options --> Peripherals --> General`.
  By default all buttons are mapped to Joystick fire.

==== GCW0 Keyboard ====
This option allows to map handheld buttons to ZX Spectrum keys. The cursors also can be mapped.

  - Type: Choose Activated or None. Default is None.
  - Button mapping: Map buttons to ZX Spectrum keys or Nothing. By default all buttons are mapped to Nothing.

--------------------------

When both mappings, "GCW0 Joystick 1" and "GCW0 Keyboard", are enabled at the same time only "GCW0 Joystick 1" will work.

When you choose any 'Type' other than "None" in "GCW0 Joystick 1" or "GCW0 Keyboard", some buttons may lose their original functionality if they are
mapped to joystick fire or to keyboard keys.
  - `Select`, `Start`, `L1` and `R1` buttons have functionanility that may be lost.
  - If you have mapped the `Select` button, you can still access the menu with the` Power` button.

----------------------------------------------
### Control mapping per game configuration ###
----------------------------------------------

To have control gaming configuration per game you must activate it in the menu 'Options -> Joysticks -> Control mapping'.

Files for save control mapping:
  - The configuration files per game are saved in 'mappings' directory in fuse config path ($HOME/.fuse/mappings).
  - They have extension '.fcm' (fcm is for Fuse Control Mapping).
  - The options saved are the 'Types' and buttons mappings for GCW0 Joystick 1, Joystick 2, Keyboard and GCW0 Keyboard.
  - The format of the file is the same used for the general settings: XML for OpenDingux or plain text for RetroFW.
  - By default for the control mapping filenames will be tried to detect some patterns on name to cut them off:
        - All the denominations between '()' or '[]'
        - 'Tape', 'Disk', 'Side' for 'ABCD' or '1234', 'Part 1234 of 1234'
        - The '128k', '48k' out of '()' '[]'
        - The 'Small, Medium, Large' whatever 'Case'
        (The search of patterns are case insensitive)

The supported media for auto-load control mapping files are tapes, microdrives, snapshots, disks (not IDE), rom cartridges and Timex cartridges.

See PITFALLs at the end of this section.

Options:
  - Control mapping per game:
    -------------------------
    Default disabled.
    It enable the save and load of control mappings per game for supported media: : tapes, snapshots, disks (not IDE), rom cartridges, Timex cartridges.

    If you disable it:
      - If defaults are detached they are saved and restored as current defaults.
      - If changes were made to controls those changes are saved to correponding control mapping file.

    If you enable it:
      - If defaults are detached they are loaded.
      - If you do after you have load any supported media the emulator try to initialize control mapping for that media.

  - Auto-load:
    ----------
    Default enabled. Only take effect if 'Control mapping per game' is enabled.

    If enabled the autoload of control mapping files associated to the file loaded.
    This apply for supported media when are loaded from 'File -> Open' or inserted from the 'Media' menu.

  - Auto-save:
    ----------
    Default enabled. Only take effect if 'Control mapping per game' is enabled.

    If controls mapping has changed then the autosave will be at this events:
       - Load another media
       - Clear or eject the media in the file at 'Media' menu
       - Disabling 'Control mapping per game'
       - Exit the emulator

  - Not detached defaults:
    ----------------------
    Default disabled. Only take effect if 'Control mapping per game' is enabled.

    If this option is enabled you can't maintain separated default controls.

    The default controls are used:
      - At start of Fuse, if no media is autoload or no control mapping autoload is enable
      - When you insert a media with not yet control mapping configuration
      - When you clear or eject a media

  - No cut/transform filenames:
    ---------------------------
    Default disabled. Only take effect if 'Control mapping per game' is enabled.

    With this option enabled the filename for mapping control will be the same of the file loaded replacing the extension by '.fmc'.
    With this option disabled the control mapping filename follow the rules indicated above.

When you exit from Fuse and have General Auto-save setting enabled then default control mapping will be saved at general file.

Other options in Joystick menu for Control mapping:

  - Load control mapping:
    ---------------------
    Enabled if 'Control mapping per game' is enabled.

    When a control mapping file exists for the last media loaded then it's name will be printed here, only the first 20 characters of name.
    This option allows to restore controls mapping from configuration file if changes have been made to them.

  - Save control mapping:
    ---------------------
    Enabled if 'Control mapping per game' is enabled.

    If supported media is inserted then the name of control mapping file will be printed here, only the first 20 characters of name.
    This allow you to save the current control mapping if changes have been made to them or if the file does not exist yet.

    If Auto-save of control mapping is active the save will be at designed evets, see 'Auto-save' options. You can force the save with this option.

  - Load control mapping from file:
    -------------------------------
    Allways enabled.

    This option allow you to load a control mapping file to change the current control mappings.

  - Save control mapping from file:
    -------------------------------
    Allways enabled.

    This option allows you to save a control mapping file with the current control mappings.

  - Default control mapping:
    ------------------------
    Enabled when 'Control mapping per game' is enabled and 'Not detached defaults' is disabled.

    Submenu to maintain default control mapping.

  - Reset to default controls:
    --------------------------
    Enabled when 'Control mapping per game' is enabled and 'Not detached defaults' is disabled.

    Reset the current controls to default control mapping.

  - Set current as default:
    -----------------------
    Enabled when 'Control mapping per game' is enabled and 'Not detached defaults' is disabled.

    Set the current controls as the default control mapping.

PITFALLS:
  Variants of the same program:
    If 'No cut/transform filenames' is disabled (default) the emulator try to clean the name of filename to make it equal name for variations.
    But if the filenames used are no consistent, including letter case, then a different name for the same program may be determined.

  When insert various media the last inserted will be the selected control mapping.
    - If you unload it then it will be cleared and you could start a game from other media inserted with no file control mapping.
    - If you start from Loader the system can load from media different to the last assigned control mapping file.

  Example:
    1.- Select +3 machine
    2.- Open media menu and insert a disk
    3.- Open media menu and insert a tape
    4.- The control mapping file will be the last tape inserted
    5.- Open media menu and clear tape
    6.- Now there is not control mapping file assigned but you can load a program from disk

  Bugs aside, probably there are other scenarios not taken into account but I believe that the most relevant use cases are covered.

-------------------------
### External joystick ###
-------------------------

On some handhelds it is possible to connect an external Joystick using USB OTG. The mapping of 'Joystick 2' will be applied to it.

For controllers the number of each button in mapping depends on the controller layout.

=>Fuse count buttons from 1 not from 0, so add 1 to translate your layout into Fuse's config.

|On my RG350 I've tested this with an 8Bitdo FC30 Pro controller.
|The mapping layout: A=1, B=2, X=4, Y=5, L1=7, R1=8, L2=9, R2=10, Select=11, Start=12, L3=14, R3=15.
|From SDL Game controller DB (https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt)
    "03000000c82d00001038000000000000,8BitDo FC30 Pro,
        a:b0,b:b1,back:b10,dpdown:h0.4,dpleft:h0.8,dpright:h0.2,dpup:h0.1,

	hint:SDL_GAMECONTROLLER_USE_BUTTON_LABELS:=1,"

-------------------------
### External keyboard ###
-------------------------

I don't have tested a Keyboard on USB OTG but in theory it should "work".
But keep in mind that current adaptations made for handhelds buttons have probably made it unusable.

The handheld buttons are keystrokes that have conflict with some keys used for SDL menus.

----------------------
### Kempston mouse ###
----------------------

In some handhelds you can emulate mouse with the Right stick and `L2`, `R2` buttons.
This make possible emulating the Kempston mouse.
You must enable 'Kempston mouse' in the peripherals: `Menu -> Options -> Peripherals -> General`, and enable the mouse emulation in the handheld.

|For example, in the RG350 you can activate the mouse with hotkey `Power` + `B`.

---------------------
### Triple Buffer ###
---------------------

There is an implementation to use the triple buffer. It can be enabled at 'General GCW0' options or whith combo hotkeys 'L1' + 'R1' + 'B'.

If tripple buffer is activated then an [B] will be at status line.

It affect to the speed of emulator that can be observed in the speed for fastloading.

In general I believe that is not needed, but I've seen diference activating it on some demos for Pentagon's models as "mescaline synesthesia by deMarche".

BUG: At disabling triple buffer sometimes the screen will be frozen but the emulator still will be running .
     This is surely motivated by some mistake on my code or for missunderestanding triple buffer by my side.

---------------------------
### Hotkey combinations ###
---------------------------

For use hotkey combos it they must be enabled in 'Menu -> Options -> General GCW0'.

If `L1` and `R1` buttons are not mapped to Joystick or Keyboard it will be used to start the hotkey combinations.

The implemented hotkeys correspond to Fx key functions in Fuse's SDL implementation:

    L1 + R1 + B      Toggle triple buffer
    L1 + R1 + X      Joystick
    L1 + Select + Y  Tape play (F8)
    L1 + A           Tape open (F7)
    L1 + B           Save file (F2)
    L1 + X           Open file (F3)
    L1 + Y           Media menu
    R1 + A           General options (F4)
    R1 + B           Reset machine (F5)
    R1 + X           Exit fuse (F10)
    R1 + Y           Machine select (F9)

---------------------
### Media options ###
---------------------

If you have problems loading some programs keep in mind the compatibility issues of software with the model emulated.

Also some options in 'Media' options can influence to some loaders as 'Accelerate loaders'. Try enabling/disabling different otions.

------------
### ROMs ###
------------

Fuse provides roms for some systems and peripherals it emulate but not for all models or peripherals that it support.

You can assign new roms or change the defaults from the emulator itself:

- Open menu with `Select` or `Power` button. Then navigate from Menu --> Options --> Select Roms --> Machine ROMs or Peripheral ROMs
- With `cursor` select the rom to change and press `X` button
- At file selector use the `cursor` keys to navigate to folder where your roms are located and to select the needed rom. And press the `A` button to confirm selection.
- Repeat until all the needed ROMs are assigned.
- Finally do accept all pressing the `A` button.

You can reset a rom to default with the `Y` button.

NOTE:
  The emulator detect your rom as custom if they not have the name expected, including the path.
  This affect to auto-load media (tapes, disks). In standard Fuse compilation cutoms roms don't autoload.
  The option "Auto-load media with custom rom" in General options (default False) auto-load also with custom roms.

Also roms con be added to the 'rom' directory in config path ("$HOME/.fuse/roms").
Fuse search in this path for rom files with the default names.

    For OpenDingux   "/media/data/local/home/.fuse/roms"
    For RetroFW      "/home/retrofw/.fuse/roms"

|Fuse will create the config paths at starting if they don't exist.

NAME
       fuse -- Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator

SYNOPSIS
       fuse [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Fuse  is  a  Sinclair  ZX Spectrum emulator. It supports several models
       (including the 128), with quite faithful emulation of the  display  and
       sound.

       The emulator can load any of the formats supported by libspectrum(3) --
       this includes Z80, SNA and SZX snapshots, and PZX, TAP and TZX virtual-
       tape  files.  Saving to SZX, Z80 and SNA snapshots and TZX and TAP tape
       files is supported. The SLT extension to the Z80 format is partly  sup-
       ported  (enough for multi-load games); however, loading of the old DAT-
       file variant is not.

       DSK, UDI, FDI, TD0, MGT, IMG, D40, D80, SAD,  TRD,  SCL  and  OPD  disk
       images are supported when a disk interface is being emulated, including
       the integrated disk drives on +3, Pentagon or Scorpion machines as well
       as  the  +D,  DISCiPLE, Opus Discovery, Beta 128 and Didaktik 80 inter-
       faces. DCK cartridge images are supported when emulating  a  Timex 2068
       variant. Interface 2 ROM cartridges are also supported.

       Finally,  there  is  also support for reading and writing the RZX input
       recording format.

       See the COMPRESSED FILES section for  details  on  reading  files  com-
       pressed with bzip2(3), gzip(3) or zip(3).

OPTIONS
       --accelerate-loader
              Specify  whether  Fuse should attempt to accelerate tape loaders
              by "short circuiting" the loading loop.  This  will  in  general
              speed  up  loading, but may cause some loaders to fail. (Enabled
              by default, but you can  use  `--no-accelerate-loader'  to  dis-
              able). The same as the Media Options dialog's Accelerate loaders
              option.

       --aspect-hint
              Specify whether the GTK+ and Xlib user interfaces should  `hint'
              to  the  window manager about the preferred aspect ratio for the
              graphics window, thus preventing resizing  to  non-square  sizes
              which  lead  to  Fuse  not displaying correctly. This option has
              been observed to cause problems with some window  managers  when
              using  the  GTK+  UI  which  can  prevent  the window from being
              resized or moved at all. (Enabled by default, but  you  can  use
              `--no-aspect-hint'     to     disable).     See     also     the
              `--strict-aspect-hint' option.

       --autosave-settings
              Specify whether Fuse's current settings should be  automatically
              saved  on  exit.  The same as the General Options dialog's Auto-
              save settings option.

       --auto-load
              Specify whether tape and  disk  files  should  be  automatically
              loaded  when  they  are  opened  using  the  File, Open...  menu
              option. In the case of TRD/SCL disk images, inserts also a  boot
              loader file when none is available. (Enabled by default, but you
              can use `--no-auto-load' to disable). Same as the Media  Options
              dialog's Auto-load media option.

       --beta128
              Emulate  a  Beta 128  interface.  Same  as  the Disk Peripherals
              Options dialog's Beta 128 interface option.

       --beta128-48boot
              When a Beta 128 interface is used in 48K or TC2048 emulation the
              option  additionally controls whether the machine boots directly
              into the TR-DOS system. Same as  the  Disk  Peripherals  Options
              dialog's Beta 128 auto-boot in 48K machines option.

       --betadisk file
              Insert  the  specified  file  into the emulated Beta disk inter-
              face's drive A: and select Pentagon mode on startup.

       --bw-tv
              Specify whether the display should simulate a  colour  or  black
              and  white  television. This option is effective under the GTK+,
              Win32, Xlib and SDL user interfaces: the others will always sim-
              ulate  a  colour  TV.   The same as the General Options dialog's
              Black and white TV option.

       --cmos-z80
              This option specifies that Fuse should emulate a  CMOS  Z80,  as
              opposed to an NMOS Z80. Same as the General Options dialog's Z80
              is CMOS option.

       --competition-code code

              Specify whether `dangerous' actions  (those  which  could  cause
              data loss, for example resetting the Spectrum) require confirma-
              tion before occurring. (Enabled by  default,  but  you  can  use
              `--no-confirm-actions'  to  disable). This option is the same as
              the General Options dialog's Confirm actions option.

       --covox
              Emulate a Covox sound interface for Pentagon/Scorpion.  Same  as
              the General Peripherals Options dialog's Covox option.

       --debugger-command string
              Specify  a  debugger  command to be run before emulator startup.
              This can be used to set breakpoints or the like. Currently, this
              is  the  only method to input multi-line debugger commands. (See
              the MONITOR/DEBUGGER section for more information).

       --detect-loader
              Specify whether Fuse should attempt to detect when the  tape  is
              being accessed and start and stop the virtual tape playing auto-
              matically.   (Enabled   by   default,   but    you    can    use
              `--no-detect-loader' to disable). Same as the Media Options dia-
              log's Detect loaders option.

       --disciple
              Emulate a DISCiPLE  interface.  Same  as  the  Disk  Peripherals
              Options dialog's DISCiPLE interface option.

       --discipledisk file
              Insert the specified file into the emulated DISCiPLE's drive 1.

       --didaktik80
              Emulate  a  Didaktik 80 (or Didaktik 40) disk interface. Same as
              the Disk Peripherals  Options  dialog's  Didaktik  80  interface
              option.

       --didaktik80disk file
              Insert  the  specified  file  into  the emulated Didaktik 80 (or
              Didaktik 40)'s drive A.

       --disk-ask-merge
              Prompt the user to confirm whether Fuse should try to merge  the
              `B' side of a disk image from a separate file when opening a new
              single-sided disk image.

       --disk-try-merge mode
              Select whether Fuse should try to merge a separate file for  the
              `B'  side  of a disk image separate file when opening a new disk
              image. Most double sided disk images are dumped  as  two  single
              sided  disk  images  e.g.  `Golden Axe - Side A.dsk' and `Golden
              Axe - Side B.dsk'. So, if we want to play Golden Axe,  first  we
              have  to  insert  the first disk image and when the game asks to
              insert side B, we have to find and open the second  disk  image,
              instead  of  just  `flip'-ing  the  disk  inside  the  drive. If
              enabled, Fuse will try to open the second image too and create a
              double  sided disk image (merging the two one sided disk images)
              and insert this merged virtual disk into  the  disk  drive.  The
              function  detects whether the file is one side of a double-sided
              image  if  the  filename  matches  a   pattern   like   [Ss]ide[
              _][abAB12][ _.] in the file name of a disk that is being opened.
              If found, Fuse will try to open the other side of the  disk  too
              substituting  the  appropriate  characters  in the filename e.g.
              1->2, a->b, A->B. If successful  then  it  will  merge  the  two
              images  and now we have a double sided disk in drive. This means
              that if we open `Golden Axe - Side A.dsk', then Fuse will try to
              open  `Golden Axe - Side B.dsk' too. Now, we can just `flip' the
              disk if Golden Axe asks for `Side B'.  The available options are
              Never, With single-sided drives and Always.

       --divide
              Emulate  the  DivIDE interface. The same as the Disk Peripherals

       --dock file
              Insert  the  specified file into the emulated Timex 2068 variant
              dock; also select the TC2068 on startup if available.

       -D mode
       --doublescan-mode mode
              Specify whether to use doublescan modes in the FB UI.  Available
              values  for mode are 0, 1 and 2. 0 means `never doublescan' (use
              640x480 at either 72 Hz or 60 Hz), whereas 1  and  2  both  mean
              `try to use doublescan' and will fall back on the 640x480 modes.
              1 selects 72 Hz modes (the same size and shape as  your  typical
              640x480), and 2 selects 60 Hz modes (overscan).

              If your monitor displays a blank screen when using 1 or 2, press
              F10 then try a different option or say `--fbmode 640'.

              produce  scanlines  along  the  lines  of the TV 2x and Timex TV
              scalers.  The same as the General Options  dialog's  PAL-TV  use
              TV2x effect option.

       --phantom-typist-mode mode
              Specify  the keystroke sequence that the "phantom typist" should
              use when starting a program loading. The available  options  are
              Auto, Keyword, Keystroke, Menu, Plus 2A and Plus 3.  The same as
              the Media Options dialog's Phantom typist mode option.

              select the +3 on startup if available.

       --plus3-detect-speedlock
              Specify  whether the +3 drives try to detect Speedlock protected
              disks, and emulate `weak' sectors.  If the disk image file (EDSK
              or  UDI)  contains weak sector data, than Speedlock detection is
              automatically omitted.  See also the  WEAK  DISK  DATA  section.
              Same as the Disk Options dialog's +3 Detect Speedlock option.

       --plusd
              Emulate  a  +D  interface.  Same as the Disk Peripherals Options
              dialog's +D interface option.

              The names in brackets denote the defaults.  Note  that  not  all
              these  ROMs  are  supplied with Fuse -- you must supply your own
              copies of those which are not.

       --no-rs232-handshake
              This option makes Fuse's Interface 1 emulation assume  that  the
              RS-232 line other end is live when you connect the communication
              channels.  See also the `--rs232-rx' and `--rs232-tx' options.

       --rs232-rx
       --rs232-tx
              Specify the communication channels (FIFO or file) to be used for
              Interface 1  RS-232  emulation as RxD and TxD wire. See also the
              `--rs232-handshake' options.

       --rzx-autosaves
              Specify that, while recording an RZX file, Fuse should automati-
              cally  add  a  snapshot to the recording stream every 5 seconds.
              (Default to on, but you can  use  `--no-rzx-autosaves'  to  dis-
              able). Same as the RZX Options dialog's Create autosaves option;
              see there for more details.

       --sdl-fullscreen-mode mode
              Select a screen resolution for full screen mode. Available  val-
              ues  for  mode  are  listed in a table, when Fuse is called with
              --sdl-fullscreen-mode list command line option.  This option  is
              effective only under the SDL UI.

       --separation type
              Give  stereo  separation of the 128's AY sound channels. Same as
              the General Options dialog's AY stereo  separation  option.  The
              available options are None, ACB, and ABC.  The default option is
              None.

       --simpleide
              Specify whether Fuse will emulate the simple 8-bit IDE interface
              as  used  by  the  Spectrum +3e.  Same  as  the Disk Peripherals
              Options dialog's Simple 8-bit IDE option.

       --simpleide-masterfile file
              Specify a HDF file to connect to the emulated Simple  8-bit  IDE
              interface's master channel.

       --simpleide-slavefile file
              Specify  a  HDF file to connect to the emulated Simple 8-bit IDE
              interface's slave channel.

       --slt
              Support the SLT trap instruction. (Enabled by default,  but  you
              can  use  `--no-slt' to disable). Same as the Media Options dia-
              log's Use .slt traps option.

       -s file
       --snapshot file
              Specify a snapshot file to load. The file can be in any snapshot
              format supported by libspectrum(3).

       --sound
              Specify  whether Fuse should produce sound. (Enabled by default,
              but you can use `--no-sound' to  disable).  Same  as  the  Sound
              Options dialog's Sound enabled option.

       -d device
       --sound-device device
              Specify  the  sound output device to use and any options to give
              that device. If you are not using the SDL UI or using  libao  or
              libasound  (ALSA)  for  sound  output, then the device parameter
              just specifies the device to be used for sound output.

              If you are using the SDL UI, the device parameter allows you  to
              specify  the  audio  driver to be used (e.g. dsp, alsa, dma, esd
              and arts).

              If you are using libao for sound output,  the  device  parameter
              allows  you  to specify the device used for sound output (either
              `live' to a speaker or to a file) and the parameters to be  used
              for  that  device. In general, the device parameter has the form
              driver[:param[=value][,param[=value][,...]].  driver selects the
              libao driver to be used, either one of the `live' drivers (aixs,
              alsa, alsa09, arts, esd, irix, macosx, nas, oss  or  sun)  or  a
              file driver (au, raw, wav or null).  The available parameter and
              value pairs for each device are:

              o      aixs: AIX audio system

                     o      dev=device
                            `device' gives the AIX sound device.

              o      alsa: Advanced Linux Sound Architecture version 0.5.x

                     o      card=num
                            `num' gives the ALSA card number.

                     o      dev=num
                            `num' gives the ALSA device number.

                     o      buf_size=num
                            `num' gives the ALSA buffer size in bytes.

              o      alsa09: Advanced Linux Sound Architecture version 0.9+

                     o      dev=string
                            `string' specifies the ALSA device e.g. hw:1.2

                     o      buffer_time=num
                            `num' gives the ALSA buffer time in microseconds.

                     o      period_time=num
                            `num' gives the ALSA period time in microseconds.

                     o      use_mmap=yes|y|true|t|1
                            specifies that libao use memory mapped transfer.

              o      arts: aRts soundserver: no parameters.

              o      esd: Enlightened Sound Daemon.

                     o      host=string
                            `string' gives the ESD host specification.

              o      irix: IRIX Audio Library: no parameters.

              o      macosx: MacOS X CoreAudio: no parameters.

              o      nas: Network Audio System.

                     o      host=string
                            `string' gives the NAS host specification.

                     o      buf_size=num
                            `num' gives the buffer size on the server.

              o      oss: Open Sound System.

                     o      dsp=string
                            `string' gives the OSS  device  to  be  used  e.g.
                            /dev/sound/dsp1

              o      sun: SUN audio system.

                     o      dev=string
                            `string' gives the audio device to be used.

              o      au: SUN Sparc audio file: no parameters.

              o      raw: raw file.

                     o      byteorder=string
                            `string'  can  be any of native (host native byte-
                            order),  big  (big  endian)  or   little   (little
                            endian).

              o      wav: Microsoft audio file: no parameters.

              o      null: null output: no parameters.

              o      debug: for debugging libao.

              Finally, each of the file output types (au, raw and wav) have an
              extra option `file=filename' where  `filename'  gives  the  file
              output  will be directed to. This defaults to `fuse-sound.ao' if
              it is not specified.

              Some examples of use:

              fuse -d alsa09:dev=hw:1

              causes Fuse to use ALSA 0.9+ output with the second  (#1)  sound
              card.

              fuse -d raw:byteorder=little,file=enigma.raw

              causes Fuse to save little endian words to `enigma.raw'.

              See the `DEVICE' section of ogg123(1) for up to date information
              of devices and options (except for the `file'  option  which  is
              provided by Fuse itself).

              If  you are using libasound or ALSA for sound output, the device
              parameter allows you to specify the device used for sound output
              and  some parameters to be used for that device. In general, the
              device parameter has the form
              devstr or
              param[=value][,param[=value][,...][,devstr].

              o      devstr: selects the ALSA device used, it can be any  com-
                     plex or simple ALSA device name. e.g.: default or hw:0 or
                     tee:plughw:0,'/tmp/out.raw',raw.  See  the  alsa-lib  pcm
                     api                      reference                     at
                     http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html
                     for further explanation.

              o      param and values:

                     o      buffer=nnnn:   set  the  ALSA  buffer  in  frames,
                            smaller value cause smaller sound  delay  but  may
                            more  buffer  underrun  (pops  and clicks), larger
                            value cause longer delay but  fewer  underrun.  By
                            default  Fuse  determine  the buffer size based on
                            the actual sound frequency.

                            If you use some special plugin for your pcm device
                            (e.g.:  dmix) or your card not support some needed
                            parameter (e.g.  cannot  play  other  only  48 kHz
                            stereo  sound like some AC97 sound card) may cause
                            Fuse unable to set the needed buffer size,  appro-
                            priate sound frequency, channels and so on, there-
                            fore you cannot get optimal result or not hear the
                            sound  at  all.  In  this  case  try the plughw:#,
                            (where # mean your card number counted from 0) for
                            ALSA device.

                     o      verbose : if given, fuse report ALSA buffer under-
                            runs to stderr.

              Some examples of use:

              fuse -d verbose,buffer=2000

              causes Fuse to use the  default  ALSA  device  with  2000  frame
              length buffer and report ALSA buffer underruns on stderr.

              fuse -d tee:plughw:0,'/tmp/aufwm.raw',raw

              causes  Fuse  to  use  the  first card and parallel save the raw
              audio samples into /tmp/aufwm.raw file.

       --sound-force-8bit
              Force the use of 8-bit sound, even if 16-bit is  possible.  Same
              as the Sound Options dialog's Force 8-bit option.

       -f frequency
       --sound-freq frequency
              Specify what frequency Fuse should use for the sound device, the
              default is 44.1 kHz, but some devices only support a single fre-
              quency or a limited range (e.g.  48 kHz or up to 22 kHz).

       --speaker-type type
              Select  the  output  speaker  emulation, type can be TV speaker,
              Beeper or Unfiltered. Same as the Sound Options dialog's Speaker
              type option.

       --speccyboot
              Emulate  a  SpeccyBoot  Ethernet  interface. Same as the General
              Peripherals Options dialog's SpeccyBoot option. See the  Speccy-
              Boot  web page at http://patrikpersson.github.io/speccyboot/ for
              full details on the SpeccyBoot.

       --speccyboot-tap device
              Specify the TAP device to use for SpeccyBoot emulation.

       --specdrum
              Emulate a SpecDrum interface. Same as  the  General  Peripherals
              Options  dialog's  SpecDrum  option.  See  the World of Spectrum
              Infoseek  web  page   at   http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infos-
              eekid.cgi?id=1000062 for manuals, software and more.

       --spectranet
              Specify whether Fuse will emulate the Spectranet Ethernet inter-
              face.  Same as the General Peripherals  Options  dialog's  Spec-
              tranet  option.  See  the  SPECTRANET EMULATION section for more
              details.

       --spectranet-disable
              This option controls the state of the Spectranet automatic page-
              in jumper (J2). Same as the General Peripherals Options dialog's
              Spectranet disable option. See the SPECTRANET EMULATION  section
              for more details.

       --speed percentage
              Specify  the  speed  (as a percentage of real Spectrum speed) at
              which emulation should attempt to proceed. Same as  the  General
              Options dialog's Emulation speed option.

       --statusbar
              For  the  GTK+  and  Win32 UI, enables the statusbar beneath the
              display. For the Xlib and SDL UI, enables the status icons show-
              ing  whether  the  disk and tape are being accessed. Same as the
              General Options dialog's Show statusbar option.

       --strict-aspect-hint
              For the GTK+ UI, use stricter limits for the aspect ratio limits
              set  by  the  `--aspect-hint' option. This can cause some window
              managers (for example, metacity(1)) to not allow the  window  to
              be  resized  and  moved, but is necessary to prevent others (for
              example, fvwm(1)) from being able resize the  window  away  from
              square.

       --svga-modes mode1,mode2,mode3
              Specify  which  SVGA mode to use for the SVGAlib UI at different
              screen sizes. Available values for mode1, mode2  and  mode3  are
              listed  in a table, when Fuse called with --svga-modes list com-
              mand line option.  When user select a not available mode  for  a
              size,  Fuse  just  ignore  and try to find the best mode for it.
              e.g.  with  --svga-modes   0,0,12   Fuse   use   the   specified
              1024x768x256  SVGA mode for triple size filters, but select SVGA
              modes automatically for normal  or  double  size  filters.   The
              above mode number is just an example, and mode numbers and their
              meanings may vary graphics card by graphics card.

       -t file
       --tape file
              Specify a virtual tape file to use. It must be in  PZX,  TAP  or
              TZX format.

       --textfile file
              Set  the  filename used for text output from the emulated print-
              ers. See the PRINTER EMULATION section below for more details.

       --traps
              Support traps for ROM tape loading/saving. (Enabled by  default,
              but  you  can  use  `--no-traps'  to disable). Same as the Media
              Options dialog's Use tape traps option.

       --unittests
              This option runs a testing framework that  automatically  checks
              portions  of  code, comparing actual results with expected ones.
              It is meant to detect broken code before a release. There is not
              graphical  mode,  the  program just ends with exit code 0 if all
              tests are good or prints error messages to stdout and ends  with
              exit code greater than 0 if there are failed tests.

       --usource
              Emulate  a  Source  interface.  Same  as the General Peripherals
              Options dialog's Source option.

       -V
       --version
              Show which version of Fuse is being used.

       --volume-ay volume
              Sets the relative volume of the AY-3-8912 chip from a  range  of
              0-100%. Same as the Sound Options dialog's AY volume option.

       --volume-beeper volume
              Sets  the  relative volume of the beeper from a range of 0-100%.
              Same as the Sound Options dialog's Beeper volume option.

       --volume-covox volume
              Sets the relative volume of the Covox from a  range  of  0-100%.
              Same as the Sound Options dialog's Covox volume option.

       --volume-specdrum volume
              Sets the relative volume of the SpecDrum from a range of 0-100%.
              Same as the Sound Options dialog's SpecDrum volume option.

       --writable-roms
              Allow Spectrum programs to overwrite the ROM(s). The same as the
              General Options dialog's Allow writes to ROM option.

       --zxatasp
              Specify  whether Fuse emulate the ZXATASP interface. Same as the
              Disk Peripherals Options dialog's ZXATASP interface option.

       --zxatasp-upload
              Specify the state of the ZXATASP upload jumper. Same as the Disk
              Peripherals Options dialog's ZXATASP upload option.

       --zxatasp-write-protect
              Specify  the  state of the ZXATASP write protect jumper. Same as
              the Disk Peripherals  Options  dialog's  ZXATASP  write  protect
              option.

       --zxatasp-masterfile file
              Specify  a  HDF  file  to connect to the emulated ZXATASP inter-
              face's master channel.

       --zxatasp-slavefile file
              Specify a HDF file to connect to  the  emulated  ZXATASP  inter-
              face's slave channel.

       --zxcf
              Specify  whether  Fuse  emulate  the ZXCF interface. Same as the
              Disk Peripherals Options dialog's ZXCF interface option.

       --zxcf-upload
              Specify the state of the ZXCF upload jumper. Same  as  the  Disk
              Peripherals Options dialog's ZXCF upload option.

       --zxcf-cffile file
              Specify a HDF file to connect to the emulated ZXCF interface.

       --zxmmc
              Emulate  the  ZXMMC  interface. The same as the Disk Peripherals
              Options dialog's ZXMMC interface option.

       --zxmmc-file file
              Specify an HDF image to be loaded into the ZXMMC's emulated mem-
              ory card.

       --zxprinter
              Emulate  the ZX Printer. Same as the General Peripherals Options
              dialog's ZX Printer option.

       All long options which control on/off settings can  be  disabled  using
       `--no-foo'  (for  an  option  `--foo').   For  example, the opposite of
       `--issue2' is `--no-issue2'.  These options can also be modified  while
       the  emulator is running, using the options dialogs -- see the documen-
       tation for the Options menu in the MENUS AND KEYS section for details.

THE VARIOUS FRONT-ENDS
       Fuse supports various front-ends, or UIs (user interfaces).  The  usual
       one  is  GTK+-based,  but  there are also SDL, Win32, Xlib, SVGAlib and
       framebuffer ones.

       The important difference to note is that GTK+ and Win32  versions  uses
       `native'  dialog  boxes  etc.  (behaving like a fairly normal GUI-based
       program) while the others use  an  alternative,  Fuse-specific  `widget
       UI'.  This  latter  front-end  is easily spotted by the way it uses the
       main Fuse window/screen for menus and dialogs, and uses the  Spectrum's
       own font.

MENUS AND KEYS
       Since  many of the keys available are devoted to emulation of the Spec-
       trum's keyboard, the primary way of  controlling  Fuse  itself  (rather
       than  the  emulated  machine) is via the menus. There are also function
       key shortcuts for some menu options.

       In the GTK+ and Win32 version, the menu bar is always  visible  at  the
       top  of  the  Fuse  window.  You can click on a menu name to pop it up.
       Alternatively, you can press F1 to display a pop-up version of the menu
       bar, which you can then navigate with the cursor keys or mouse.

       In  the widget UI pressing F1 is the only way to get the main menu; and
       unlike the GTK+ version, the emulator pauses while the menus are  being
       navigated.  The  menus  show which key to press for each menu option in
       brackets. Pressing Esc exits a menu, and pressing Enter exits the  menu
       system entirely (as well as `confirming' any current dialog).

       Here's  what  the menu options do, along with the function key mappings
       for those items which have them:

       F3
       File, Open...
              Open a Spectrum file. Snapshots will be loaded into memory; tape
              images  will be inserted into the emulated tape deck, and if the
              Auto-load media option is set will being loading. Opening a disk
              image  or  a Timex dock image will cause the appropriate machine
              type (+3, Pentagon or TC2068) to  be  selected  with  the  image
              inserted,  and  disks  will  automatically load if the Auto-load
              media option is set. See the FILE SELECTION  section  below  for
              details  on  how to choose the file. Note that this behaviour is
              different from previous versions of Fuse, when this option would
              open only snapshots.

       F2
       File, Save Snapshot...
              Save  a snapshot (machine state, memory contents, etc.) to file.
              You can select the filename to be saved to. If it  has  a  .szx,
              .z80  or .sna extension, the snapshot will be saved in that for-
              mat. Otherwise, it will be saved as a .szx file.

       File, Recording, Record...
              Start recording input to an RZX file, initialised from the  cur-
              rent  emulation  state.  You  will be prompted for a filename to
              use.

       File, Recording, Record from snapshot...
              Start recording input to an RZX file, initialised from  a  snap-
              shot.  You  will first be asked for the snapshot to use and then
              the file to save the recording to.

       File, Recording, Continue recording...
              Continue recording input into an existing RZX file from the last
              recorded state. Finalised recordings cannot be resumed. You will
              be prompted for the recording to continue.

       Insert
       File, Recording, Insert snapshot
              Inserts a snapshot of the current state into the RZX file.  This
              can  be used at a later point to roll back to the inserted state
              by using one of the commands below.

       Delete
       File, Recording, Rollback
              Rolls back the recording to the  point  at  which  the  previous
              snapshot was inserted. Recording will continue from that point.

       File, Recording, Rollback to...
              Roll  back the recording to any snapshot which has been inserted
              into the recording.

       File, Recording, Play...
              Playback recorded input from an RZX file. This lets  you  replay
              keypresses  recorded  previously.  RZX files generally contain a
              snapshot with the Spectrum's state at the start of  the  record-
              ing;  if the selected RZX file doesn't, you'll be prompted for a
              snapshot to load as well.

       File, Recording, Stop
              Stop any currently-recording/playing RZX file.

       File, Recording, Finalise...
              Compact an RZX file. Any interspersed snapshot will  be  removed
              and  the  recording cannot be continued. All action replays sub-
              mitted to the RZX Archive should be finalised.

       File, AY Logging, Record...
              Start recording the bytes output via the AY-3-8912 sound chip to
              a  PSG  file.  You  will  be prompted for a filename to save the
              recording to.

       File, AY Logging, Stop
              Stop any current AY logging.

       File, Screenshot, Open SCR Screenshot...
              Load an SCR screenshot (essentially just a binary  dump  of  the
              Spectrum's  video memory) onto the current screen. Fuse supports
              screenshots saved in the Timex hi-colour  and  hi-res  modes  as
              well  as  `normal' Spectrum screens, and will make a simple con-
              version if a hi-colour or hi-res screenshot  is  loaded  onto  a
              non-Timex machine.

       File, Screenshot, Save Screen as SCR...
              Save  a copy of whatever's currently displayed on the Spectrum's
              screen as an SCR file. You will be prompted for  a  filename  to
              save the screenshot to.

       File, Screenshot, Open MLT Screenshot...
              Load  an  MLT screenshot onto the current screen. The MLT format
              is similar to the SCR format but additionally supports capturing
              images  that  use techniques to display more than two colours in
              each Spectrum attribute square. Fuse will only load  the  bitmap
              version  of  an image on a Sinclair machine but on a Timex clone
              it can show the full colour detail  captured  in  the  image  by
              using the hi-colour mode.

       File, Screenshot, Save Screen as MLT...
              Save  a copy of whatever's currently displayed on the Spectrum's
              screen as an MLT file. You will be prompted for  a  filename  to
              save the screenshot to.

       File, Screenshot, Save Screen as PNG...
              Save  the current screen as a PNG file. You will be prompted for
              a filename to save the screenshot to.

       File, Scalable Vector Graphics, Start capture in line mode...
              Start trapping the video output functions present in ROM to copy
              the picture to SVG files, thus creating vectorized scalable pic-
              ture; it is expected to be fully operational in BASIC only,  but
              few  machine  code  programs  could  work,  if  they use the ROM
              addresses to output text or graphics. The initial  picture  size
              is 256x176, but it is increased everytime a `scroll' happens. On
              every CLS a  new  file  will  be  created,  with  an  increasing
              sequence  number.  CIRCLEs  will  be  described as a sequence of
              lines, so the original `imprecisions'  will  be  still  visible.
              The  text  output  will  be fully understood and decoded: normal
              ASCII characters will be converted into COURIER scalable  fonts,
              UDG  graphics  into dot matrix areas, GRAPHICS blocky characters
              into small squares.  A slightly transparent  output  permits  to
              show  a  bit of the overlapped text and graphics elements. Lower
              portion of the screen (normally bound to stream #0 and #1) won't
              be captured.

       File, Scalable Vector Graphics, Start capture in dot mode...
              As  above, but line capture is disabled. A line will be rendered
              as a sequence of dots.

       File, Scalable Vector Graphics, Stop capture
              Stop the SVG capture function.

       File, Movie, Record...
              Fuse can record movie (video and audio) into a file with special
              format  which can be converted later to a common video file for-
              mat with the fmfconv(1) utility.  You will  be  prompted  for  a
              filename to save video. Please see MOVIE RECORDING section.

       File, Movie, Record from RZX...
              Start  movie  recording  and  RZX playback at the same time. You
              will be prompted for a filename to play from and a  filename  to
              save video.

       File, Movie, Pause
              Pause movie recording which is currently in progress.

       File, Movie, Continue
              Resume movie recording which has been previously paused.

       File, Movie, Stop
              Stop movie recording which is currently in progress.

       File, Load Binary Data...
              Load  binary  data from a file into the Spectrum's memory. After
              selecting the file to load data from, you can  choose  where  to
              load the data and how much data to load.

       File, Save Binary Data...
              Save  an  arbitrary  chunk  of  the Spectrum's memory to a file.
              Select the file you wish to save to, followed  by  the  location
              and length of data you wish to save.

       F10
       File, Exit
              Exit  the  emulator.  A confirmation dialog will appear checking
              you actually want to do this.

       F4
       Options, General...
              Display the General Options dialog, letting you configure  Fuse.
              (With  the  widget  UI,  the  keys  shown in brackets toggle the
              options, Enter confirms any changes, and Esc aborts). Note  that
              any changed settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse.

              The options available are:

              Emulation speed
                     Set  how  fast Fuse will attempt to emulate the Spectrum,
                     as a percentage of the speed at which  the  real  machine
                     runs.  If  your machine isn't fast enough to keep up with
                     the requested speed, Fuse will just run  as  fast  as  it
                     can.  Note  that  if  the  emulation speed is faster than
                     500%, no sound output will be produced.

              Frame rate
                     Specify the frame  rate,  the  ratio  of  spectrum  frame
                     updates  to  real  frame  updates. This is useful if your
                     machine is having trouble keeping up  with  the  spectrum
                     screen updates.

              Issue 2 keyboard
                     Early versions of the Spectrum used a different value for
                     unused bits on the keyboard input ports, and a few  games
                     depended  on  the  old value of these bits. Enabling this
                     option switches to the old value, to let you run them.

              Recreated ZX Spectrum
                     Enable the use of a Recreated ZX Spectrum  in  `Layer  A'
                     (game)  mode.  This  is  a Bluetooth keyboard that can be
                     paired to the device where Fuse is running.

              Use shift with arrow keys
                     Treat the keyboard arrow keys  as  shifted  like  the  ZX
                     Spectrum+  keyboard's  arrow  keys or as unshifted like a
                     cursor joystick that maps to the 5, 6, 7 and 8 keys.

              Allow writes to ROM
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will happily allow  pro-
                     grams to overwrite what would normally be ROM. This prob-
                     ably isn't very useful in most circumstances,  especially
                     as the 48K ROM overwrites parts of itself.

              Late timings
                     If  selected,  Fuse will cause all screen-related timings
                     (for example, when the screen is rendered and when memory
                     contention  occurs) to be one tstate later than "normal",
                     an effect which is present on some real hardware.

              Z80 is CMOS
                     If selected, Fuse will emulate a CMOS Z80, as opposed  to
                     an  NMOS  Z80.   The undocumented `OUT (C),0' instruction
                     will be replaced with `OUT (C),255' and  emulation  of  a
                     minor  timing bug in the NMOS Z80's `LD A,I' and `LD A,R'
                     instructions will be disabled.

              RS-232 handshake
                     If you turn this option off, Fuse assumes the RS-232 line
                     other  end  is  live  when  you connect the communication
                     channels.  See also  the  `--rs232-rx'  and  `--rs232-tx'
                     options.

              Black and white TV
                     This  option  allows  you to choose whether to simulate a
                     colour or black and white television. This  is  effective
                     only under the GTK+, Win32, Xlib and SDL user interfaces:
                     the others will always simulate a colour TV.

              PAL-TV use TV2x effect
                     This option allows you to choose  whether  the  PAL TV 2x
                     and  higher  scalers also reproduce scanlines in the same
                     way as the TV 2x, TV 3x and Timex TV scalers.

              Show statusbar
                     For the GTK+ and Win32 UI, enables the statusbar  beneath
                     the  display.  For  the  SDL UI, enables the status icons
                     showing whether the disk and  tape  are  being  accessed.
                     This option has no effect for the other user interfaces.

              Snap joystick prompt
                     If  set,  Fuse will prompt you which physical joystick or
                     keyboard you want to connect to  the  joystick  interface
                     enabled  in  the  snapshot unless it already matches your
                     current configuration.

              Confirm actions
                     Specify whether `dangerous' actions  (those  which  could
                     cause  data  loss,  for  example  resetting the Spectrum)
                     require confirmation before occurring.

              Auto-save settings
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will automatically write
                     its  currently selected options to its configuration file
                     on exit (either in xml format if  libxml2  was  available
                     when  Fuse was compiled or plain text). If this option is
                     off, you'll have to manually use Options, Save afterwards
                     to  ensure  that this setting gets written to Fuse's con-
                     figuration file. Note that if you turn  this  option  on,
                     loading a snapshot could enable peripherals that would be
                     written permanently to the configuration file.

       Options, Media...
              Display the Media Options dialog, letting you  configure  Fuse's
              tape and Microdrive options. (With the widget UI, the keys shown
              in brackets toggle the options, Enter confirms any changes,  and
              Esc  aborts).  Note  that any changed settings only apply to the
              currently-running Fuse.

              Auto-load media
                     On many occasions when you open a tape or disk file, it's
                     because  it's  got a program in you want to load and run.
                     If this option is selected, this will automatically  hap-
                     pen  for  you  when you open one of these files using the
                     File, Open...  menu option -- you must then use the Media
                     menu  to  use  tapes  or disks for saving data to, or for
                     loading data into an already running program.

              Detect loaders
                     If this option is enabled, Fuse will  attempt  to  detect
                     when a loading routine is in progress, and then automati-
                     cally start the virtual tape to load the program in. This
                     is  done  by using a heuristic to identify a loading rou-
                     tine, so is by no means infallible,  but  works  in  most
                     cases.

              Phantom typist mode
                     Specify  the keystroke sequence that the "phantom typist"
                     should use when starting  a  program  loading.  Available
                     options are

                            Auto

                            Keyword

                            Keystroke

                            Menu

                            Plus 2A

                            Plus 3

                     The first four of these correspond to automatic detection
                     based on machine model, keyword  based  entry,  keystroke
                     based  entry, and selection from a 128K style menu.  Plus
                     2A and Plus 3 also correspond to selection  from  a  128K
                     style  menu,  but  have  special handling for games which
                     need to be loaded with `LOAD ""CODE'. The most likely use
                     for this option will be use Keystroke if you have changed
                     the default 48K ROM for one with keystroke entry.

              Fastloading
                     If this option is enabled, then  Fuse  will  run  at  the
                     fastest  possible speed when the virtual tape is playing,
                     thus dramatically reducing the time it takes to load pro-
                     grams. You may wish to disable this option if you wish to
                     stop the tape at a specific point.

              Use tape traps
                     Ordinarily, Fuse intercepts calls to the ROM tape-loading
                     routine  in  order  to  load from tape files more quickly
                     when possible. But this can (rarely) interfere  with  TZX
                     loading;  disabling this option avoids the problem at the
                     cost of  slower  (i.e.  always  real-time)  tape-loading.
                     When  tape-loading  traps are disabled, you need to start
                     tape playback manually, by pressing F8  or  choosing  the
                     Media, Tape, Play menu item. Fuse also uses tape traps to
                     intercept the tape-saving routine in the ROM to save tape
                     files  quickly,  tapes can also be saved using the Media,
                     Tape, Record Start menu item.

              Accelerate loaders
                     If this option is enabled,  then  Fuse  will  attempt  to
                     accelerate tape loaders by "short circuiting" the loading
                     loop. This will in general  speed  up  loading,  but  may
                     cause some loaders to fail.

              Use .slt traps
                     The  multi-load  aspect  of  SLT  files  requires  a trap
                     instruction to be supported. This instruction is not gen-
                     erally  used  except  for  this  trap, but since it's not
                     inconceivable that a program could be wanting to use  the
                     real  instruction instead, you can choose whether to sup-
                     port the trap or not.

              MDR cartridge len
                     This option controls the number of blocks in a new Micro-
                     drive cartridge.  If the value smaller than 10 or greater
                     than 254 Fuse assumes 10 or 254.  Average  real  capacity
                     is around 180 blocks (90 Kb).

              Random length MDR cartridge
                     If  this option is enabled, Fuse will use a random Micro-
                     drive cartridge length (around 180 blocks) instead of the
                     length specified in the MDR cartridge len option.

       Options, Sound...
              Display  the  Sound Options dialog, letting you configure Fuse's
              sound output. (With the widget UI, the keys  shown  in  brackets
              toggle the options, Enter confirms any changes, and Esc aborts).
              Note that any changed settings only apply to the  currently-run-
              ning Fuse.

              Sound enabled
                     Specify  whether  sound  output should be enabled at all.
                     When this option is disabled,  Fuse  will  not  make  any
                     sound.

              Loading sound
                     Normally,  Fuse  emulates tape-loading noise when loading
                     from PZXs, TAPs or TZXs in real-time, albeit at a  delib-
                     erately  lower  volume  than  on a real Spectrum. You can
                     disable  this  option  to  eliminate  the  loading  noise
                     entirely.

              AY stereo separation
                     By  default,  the sound output is mono, since this is all
                     you got from an unmodified Spectrum.  But  enabling  this
                     option gives you so-called ACB stereo (for sound from the
                     128 and other clone's AY-3-8912 sound chip).

              Force 8-bit
                     Force the use of 8-bit sound even if 16-bit (the default)
                     is  available.  Note that (when the option is enabled) if
                     8-bit sound isn't available then there will be  no  sound
                     at  all,  so  it's best not to use this option unless you
                     have a specific need for it.

              Speaker type
                     This option allows the emulation of the sound output sys-
                     tem  to  be  modified. Different choices of speaker limit
                     the bass and treble response that can  be  produced  from
                     the  machine.  Choose  between  a "TV" type speaker and a
                     small "Beeper" type  speaker  that  significantly  limits
                     bass  and  treble  response.  Choose  "Unfiltered" to get
                     unmodified (but less accurate) sound output.

              AY volume
                     Sets the relative volume of the  AY-3-8912  chip  from  a
                     range of 0-100%.

              Beeper volume
                     Sets  the  relative  volume of the beeper from a range of
                     0-100%.

              Covox volume
                     Sets the relative volume of the Covox  from  a  range  of
                     0-100%.

              SpecDrum volume
                     Sets  the relative volume of the SpecDrum from a range of
                     0-100%.

       Options, Peripherals, General...
              Display the General Peripherals Options dialog, letting you con-
              figure  the  peripherals which Fuse will consider to be attached
              to the emulated machine. (With the widget UI, the keys shown  in
              brackets toggle the options, Enter confirms any changes, and Esc
              aborts). Note that any changed settings only apply to  the  cur-
              rently-running  Fuse. Also note that any changes that enable and
              disable peripherals may result in a hard reset of  the  emulated
              machine.

              Kempston joystick
                     If  this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Kempston
                     joystick interface (probably the  most  widely  supported
                     type  on  the  Spectrum).  Note that this option is basi-
                     cally equivalent to plugging the interface itself into  a
                     Spectrum,  not to connecting a joystick; this affects how
                     the Spectrum responds to a read of input port 31. To  use
                     a  Kempston  joystick  in  a  game,  this  option must be
                     enabled, and you must also select a Kempston joystick the
                     Options, Joysticks menu.

              Kempston mouse
                     If  this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Kempston
                     mouse interface.

                     If you're using Fuse full-screen, your mouse is automati-
                     cally used as if attached to the Kempston interface. Oth-
                     erwise, you'll need to click on the Spectrum  display  in
                     order  to  tell  Fuse  to  grab  the pointer (and make it
                     invisible); to tell Fuse to release it, click the  middle
                     button (or wheel) or press Escape.

                     With the framebuffer UI, Fuse prefers to use GPM; if this
                     is not available, it will  fall  back  to  built-in  PS/2
                     mouse  support.  In  this mode, it tries /dev/input/mice,
                     /dev/mouse then /dev/psaux, stopping when it successfully
                     opens  one.  The  first  of  these is preferred since (at
                     least on Linux, with a 2.6-series  kernel)  any  type  of
                     mouse can be used and any connected mouse may be used.

              Swap mouse buttons
                     If  this option is enabled, the left and right mouse but-
                     tons will be swapped when emulating a Kempston mouse.

              Fuller Box
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will  emulate  a  Fuller
                     Box  AY  sound  and joystick interface. This emulation is
                     only available for the 16k, 48k and TC2048 machines.

              Melodik
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate  a  Melodik
                     AY  sound  interface.   These interfaces and many similar
                     ones were produced to make  the  48K Spectrum  compatible
                     with  the same AY music as the 128K Spectrum. This emula-
                     tion is only  available  for  the  16k,  48k  and  TC2048
                     machines.

              Interface 1
                     If  this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the simple
                     Sinclair Interface 1, and allow Microdrive cartridges  to
                     be connected and disconnected via the Media, Interface 1,
                     Microdrive menus. It also enables support for the  Inter-
                     face 1 RS-232 interface.

              Interface 2
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a cartridge
                     port as found on the Interface 2. Cartridges can then  be
                     inserted  and  removed  via  the Media, Cartridge, Inter-
                     face 2 menu. Note that  the  Pentagon,  Scorpion,  Inter-
                     face 2, ZXATASP and ZXCF all use the same hardware mecha-
                     nism for accessing some of their  extended  features,  so
                     only  one  of  these should be selected at once or unpre-
                     dictable behaviour will occur.

              Multiface One

                     details.

              SpecDrum interface
                     If  this  option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Cheetah
                     SpecDrum sound interface.   See  the  World  of  Spectrum
                     Infoseek     web    page    at    http://www.worldofspec-
                     trum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=1000062 for manuals,  software
                     and  more.  This emulation is only available for the 48k,
                     128k and TC2048 machines.

              Spectranet
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate  the  Spec-
                     tranet  interface,  which  provides an Ethernet interface
                     for the Spectrum. See the  SPECTRANET  EMULATION  section
                     for more details.

              Spectranet disable
                     This  option  controls  the state of the Spectranet auto-
                     matic page-in jumper (J2). See the  SPECTRANET  EMULATION
                     section for more details.

              Source
                     If  this  option  is selected, Fuse will emulate a Currah
                     Source interface.  See the World of Spectrum Infoseek web
                     page       at       http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infos-
                     eekid.cgi?id=1000080 for the manual.

              Covox interface
                     If this option is selected, Fuse  will  emulate  a  Covox
                     digital sound interface. This emulation is only available
                     for the Pentagon, Pentagon 512k, Pentagon 1024k and Scor-
                     pion  machines.  The  Pentagon variants use port 0xfb and
                     the Scorpion version uses port 0xdd.

       Options, Peripherals, Disk...
              Display the Disk Peripherals Options dialog, letting you config-
              ure  the  disk interface peripherals which Fuse will consider to
              be attached to the emulated machine. (With the  widget  UI,  the
              keys  shown  in  brackets toggle the options, Enter confirms any
              changes, and Esc aborts). Note that any  changed  settings  only
              apply  to the currently-running Fuse. Also note that any changes
              that enable and disable peripherals may result in a  hard  reset
              of the emulated machine.

              Simple 8-bit IDE
                     If  this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the simple
                     8-bit IDE interface as  used  by  the  Spectrum +3e,  and
                     allow hard disks to be connected and disconnected via the
                     Media, IDE, Simple 8-bit menu.

              ZXATASP interface
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the ZXATASP
                     interface,  which provides both additional RAM and an IDE
                     interface. See the ZXATASP  AND  ZXCF  section  for  more
                     details.

              ZXATASP upload
                     This  option  controls  the  state  of the ZXATASP upload
                     jumper.  See  the  ZXATASP  AND  ZXCF  section  for  more
                     details.

              ZXATASP write protect
                     This  option controls the state of the ZXATASP write pro-
                     tect jumper. See the ZXATASP AND ZXCF  section  for  more
                     details.

              ZXCF interface
                     If  this  option  is selected, Fuse will emulate the ZXCF
                     interface, which provides both additional RAM and a  Com-
                     pactFlash interface. See the ZXATASP AND ZXCF section for
                     more details.

              ZXCF upload
                     This option controls the state of the ZXCF upload jumper.
                     See the ZXATASP AND ZXCF section for more details.

              ZXMMC interface
                     If  this  option is selected, Fuse will emulate the ZXMMC
                     interface.  Available for +2A, +3 and +3e machines.

              DivIDE interface
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the  DivIDE
                     interface. See the DIVIDE section for more details.

              DivIDE write protect
                     This  option  controls the state of the DivIDE write pro-
                     tection jumper. See the DIVIDE section for more details.

              DivMMC interface
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the  DivMMC
                     interface. See the DIVMMC section for more details.

              DivMMC write protect
                     This  option  controls the state of the DivMMC write pro-
                     tection jumper that prevents flashing  the  EEPROM  chip.
                     See the DIVMMC section for more details.

              +D interface
                     If  this  option  is  selected,  Fuse will emulate the +D
                     interface.   See  the  +D  EMULATION  section  for   more
                     details.

              Didaktik 80 interface
                     If  this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Didak-
                     tik 80 (or Didaktik 40) interface.  See  the  DIDAKTIK 80
                     EMULATION section for more details.

              DISCiPLE interface
                     If  this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the DISCi-
                     PLE interface.  See the DISCIPLE  EMULATION  section  for
                     more details.

              Beta 128 interface
                     If  this  option  is  selected,  Fuse  will  emulate  the
                     Beta 128 interface.  See the BETA 128  EMULATION  section
                     for  more  details. Beta 128 emulation is enabled for the
                     Pentagon and Scorpion machines regardless of this option.

              Beta 128 auto-boot in 48K machines
                     If this option is selected, then when a  Beta 128  inter-
                     face is used in 48K or TC2048 emulation, the machine will
                     boot directly into the TR-DOS system.

              Opus Discovery interface
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will  emulate  the  Opus
                     Discovery  interface.   See  the OPUS DISCOVERY EMULATION
                     section for more details.

       Options, RZX...
              Display the RZX Options dialog, letting you configure how Fuse's
              deals  with  RZX input recordings. (With the widget UI, the keys
              shown  in  brackets  toggle  the  options,  Enter  confirms  any
              changes,  and  Esc  aborts). Note that any changed settings only
              apply to the currently-running Fuse.

              Create autosaves
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will add a snapshot into
                     the  recording  stream  every 5 seconds while creating an
                     RZX file, thus enabling the  rollback  facilities  to  be
                     used  without having to explicitly add snapshots into the
                     stream. Older snapshots will be pruned from the stream to
                     keep  the  file  size  and number of snapshots down: each
                     snapshot up to 15 seconds will be kept, then one snapshot
                     every  15 seconds  until  one  minute,  then one snapshot
                     every minute until 5 minutes, and then one snapshot every
                     5 minutes. Note that this "pruning" applies only to auto-
                     matically inserted snapshots: snapshots manually inserted
                     into the stream will never be pruned.

              Compress RZX data
                     If  this  option is selected, and zlib was available when
                     Fuse was compiled, any RZX files written by Fuse will  be
                     compressed.  This  is  generally a good thing as it makes
                     the files significantly smaller, and you probably want to
                     turn  it  off  only  if you're debugging the RZX files or
                     there's some other program  which  doesn't  support  com-
                     pressed RZX files.

              Competition mode
                     Any  input  recordings which are started when this option
                     is selected  will  be  made  in  `competition  mode'.  In
                     essence,  this  means that Fuse will act just like a real
                     Spectrum would: you can't load snapshots, pause the  emu-
                     lation  in any way, change the speed or anything that you
                     couldn't do on the real machine. If any of  these  things
                     are  attempted,  or  if the emulated Fuse is running more
                     than 5% faster or slower than normal Spectrum speed, then
                     the recording will immediately be stopped.

                     If  libgcrypt  was available when Fuse was compiled, then
                     recordings made with competition mode active will be dig-
                     itally  signed,  in  theory to `certify' that it was made
                     with the above restrictions in place.  However, this pro-
                     cedure  is  not  secure  (and  cannot be made so), so the
                     presence of any signature on an RZX file  should  not  be
                     taken  as  providing proof that it was made with competi-
                     tion mode active.   This  feature  is  included  in  Fuse
                     solely  as  it was one of the requirements for Fuse to be
                     used in an on-line tournament.

              Competition code
                     The numeric code entered here will be  written  into  any
                     RZX  files made in competition mode. This is another fea-
                     ture for on-line tournaments which can be used to `prove'
                     that  the  recording  was  made after a specific code was
                     released. If you're not playing in such a tournament, you
                     can safely ignore this option.

              Always embed snapshot
                     Specify  whether  a snapshot should be embedded in an RZX
                     file when recording is started from an existing snapshot.

       Options, Movie...
              Display the Movie Options  dialog,  letting  you  configure  how
              Fuse's deals with movie recordings.

              Movie compression
                     This  option  set the compression level to None, Lossless
                     or High. (See the MOVIE RECORDING section for more infor-
                     mation).

              Stop recording after RZX ends
                     If  this  option  is  selected,  Fuse will stop any movie
                     recording after an RZX playback is finished.

       Options, Joysticks
              Fuse can emulate many of the common types of joystick which were
              available  for  the  Spectrum. The input for these emulated joy-
              sticks can be taken from real joysticks attached to the  emulat-
              ing   machine  (configured  via  the  Options,  Joysticks,  Joy-
              stick 1...  and Options, Joysticks, Joystick 2...  options),  or
              from  the  q,  a, o, p, and Space keys on the emulating machines
              keyboard, configured via  the  Options,  Joysticks,  Keyboard...
              option. Note that when using the keyboard to emulate a joystick,
              the q, a, o, p, and Space keys will not have their normal effect
              (to  avoid  problems  with  games which do things like use p for
              pause when using a joystick).

              Each of the joysticks (including the `fake'  keyboard  joystick)
              can  be  configured to emulate any one of the following joystick
              types:

                     None
                            No joystick: any input will simply be ignored.

                     Cursor
                            A  cursor  joystick,  equivalent  to  pressing   5
                            (left), 6 (down), 7 (up), 8 (right), and 0 (fire).

                     Kempston
                            A Kempston joystick, read from input port 31. Note
                            that the Options, Peripherals,  General,  Kempston
                            interface option must also be set for the input to
                            be recognised.

                     Sinclair 1
                     Sinclair 2
                            The `left' and `right' Sinclair joysticks, equiva-
                            lent  to pressing 1 (left), 2 (right), 3 (down), 4
                            (up), and 5 (fire), or  6  (left),  7  (right),  8
                            (down), 9 (up), and 0 (fire) respectively.

                     Timex 1
                     Timex 2
                            The  `left'  and  `right' joysticks as attached to
                            the Timex 2068 variant's built-in joystick  inter-
                            face.

              For  the  real  joysticks, it is also possible to configure what
              effect each button on the joystick will have: this can  be  Joy-
              stick  Fire, equivalent to pressing the emulated joystick's fire
              button, Nothing, meaning to have no effect, or any Spectrum key,
              meaning that pressing that button will be equivalent to pressing
              that Spectrum key.

       Options, Select ROMs, Machine ROMs
              An individual dialog is available for each Spectrum variant emu-
              lated  by Fuse which allows selection of the ROM(s) used by that
              machine. Simply select the ROM you wish to use, and  then  reset
              the Spectrum for the change to take effect.

       Options, Select ROMs, Peripheral ROMs
              The  same  as the Machine ROMs menu, but an individual dialog is
              available for peripherals that need a ROM. Simply select the ROM
              you  wish  to use, and then reset the Spectrum for the change to
              take effect.

       Options, Filter...
              Select the graphics filter currently in use.  See  the  GRAPHICS
              FILTERS section for more details.

       F11
       Options, Full Screen
              Switch Fuse between full screen and windowed mode.  This menu is
              only available under the SDL UI.

       Options, Disk Options...
              When emulating disk drives, Fuse allows the specification of the
              physical  drive  units  attached to the emulated interface. Each
              drive can be set to be one of the following types:

                     Disabled

                     Single-sided 40 track

                     Double-sided 40 track

                     Single-sided 80 track

                     Double-sided 80 track

              The Disabled option is not supported for Drive 1 or Drive  A  of
              any interface.

              The available options that can be set are:

              +3 Drive A
                     Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.

              +3 Drive B
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              +3 Detect Speedlock
                     Specify  whether  the  +3  drives try to detect Speedlock
                     protected disks, and emulate `weak' sectors.  If the disk
                     image  file (EDSK or UDI) contains weak sector data, than
                     Speedlock detection is automatically omitted.   See  also
                     the WEAK DISK DATA section.

              Beta 128 Drive A
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              Beta 128 Drive B
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              Beta 128 Drive C
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              Beta 128 Drive D
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              +D Drive 1
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              +D Drive 2
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              Didaktik 80 Drive A
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              Didaktik 80 Drive B
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              DISCiPLE Drive 1
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              DISCiPLE Drive 2
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              Opus Drive 1
                     Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.

              Opus Drive 2
                     Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.

              Try merge 'B' side of disks
                     This  option  prompts  the  user  to confirm whether Fuse
                     should try to merge the `B' side of a disk image  from  a
                     separate file when opening a new single-sided disk image.

              Confirm merge disk sides
                     Select  whether  Fuse should try to merge a separate file
                     for the `B' side of a disk image separate file when open-
                     ing  a  new disk image. Most double sided disk images are
                     dumped as two single sided disk images e.g.  `Golden  Axe
                     -  Side A.dsk'  and  `Golden Axe - Side B.dsk'. So, if we
                     want to play Golden Axe, first  we  have  to  insert  the
                     first disk image and when the game asks to insert side B,
                     we have to find and open the second disk  image,  instead
                     of just `flip'-ing the disk inside the drive. If enabled,
                     Fuse will try to open the second image too and  create  a
                     double  sided  disk image (merging the two one sided disk
                     images) and insert this merged virtual disk into the disk
                     drive.  The function detects whether the file is one side
                     of a double-sided image if the filename matches a pattern
                     like  [Ss]ide[ _][abAB12][ _.] in the file name of a disk
                     that is being opened. If found, Fuse will try to open the
                     other  side  of the disk too substituting the appropriate
                     characters in the filename e.g.   1->2,  a->b,  A->B.  If
                     successful  then  it will merge the two images and now we
                     have a double sided disk in drive. This means that if  we
                     open  `Golden  Axe  -  Side A.dsk', then Fuse will try to
                     open `Golden Axe - Side B.dsk'  too.  Now,  we  can  just
                     `flip'  the  disk  if  Golden Axe asks for `Side B'.  The
                     available options are Never, With single-sided drives and
                     Always.

       Options, Save
              This  will cause Fuse's current options to be written to .fuserc
              in your home directory (Unix-like systems), or fuse.cfg in  your
              %USERPROFILE%  folder  (Windows), from which they will be picked
              up again when Fuse is restarted. The best  way  to  update  this
              file  is  by  using  this  option, but it's a simple XML file if
              libxml2 was available when Fuse was compiled  (otherwise,  plain
              text),  and  shouldn't be too hard to edit by hand if you really
              want to.

       Pause
       Machine, Pause
              Pause or unpause emulation. This option is available only  under
              the GTK+ and Win32 UIs; to pause the other user interfaces, sim-
              ply press F1 to bring up the main menu.

       F5
       Machine, Reset
              Reset the emulated Spectrum.

       Machine, Hard reset
              Reset the emulated Spectrum. A hard reset is equivalent to turn-
              ing the Spectrum's power off, and then turning it back on.

       F9
       Machine, Select...
              Choose  a  type of Spectrum to emulate. An brief overview of the

              Spectrum 16K
              Spectrum 48K
                     The original machines as released  by  Sinclair  in  1982
                     with 16 or 48K of RAM respectively.

              Spectrum 48K (NTSC)
                     The NTSC 48K machine released in limited numbers in parts
                     of South America.

              Spectrum 128K
                     The 128K machine as released by Sinclair in  1985 (Spain)
                     or 1986 (UK).

              Spectrum +2
                     The  first  machine released by Amstrad, in 1986. From an
                     emulation point of view, the +2 is virtually identical to
                     the 128K.

              Spectrum +2A
              Spectrum +3
                     The two machines released by Amstrad in 1988. Technically
                     very similar to each other, except that the +3 features a
                     3 disk drive while the +2A does not.

              Spectrum +3e
                     A +3 with modified ROMs allowing access to IDE hard disks
                     via the simple 8-bit interface,  as  activated  from  the
                     Options,     Peripherals,     Disk...      dialog.    See
                     http://www.worldofspectrum.org/zxplus3e/     for     more
                     details.

              Timex TC2048
              Timex TC2068
                     The variants of the Spectrum as released by Timex in Por-
                     tugal.

              Timex TS2068
                     The variant of the Spectrum released by  Timex  in  North
                     America.

              Pentagon 128K
                     Russian  clone of the Spectrum. There were many different
                     machines called Pentagon from 1989 to 2006, this  machine
                     corresponds to a 1991 era Pentagon 128K with the optional
                     AY sound chip and the integrated Beta 128 disk interface,
                     and  is  the  version of the machine most often emulated.
                     More technical details can be found at  http://www.world-
                     ofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html,

              Pentagon 512K
              Pentagon 1024K
                     Newer  versions  of  the Pentagon Russian Spectrum clones
                     which incorporate more memory and the "Mr Gluk Reset Ser-
                     vice" ROM offering a more powerful firmware.

              Scorpion ZS 256
                     Another  Russian  clone of the Spectrum. Some details can
                     be    found    at     http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rus-
                     faq/index.html.   Like  all the Russian clones, they have
                     built in 3.5 disk drives, accessed via the Beta 128  disk
                     interface  and TR-DOS (the Technology Research Disk Oper-
                     ating System). The most important  distinction  from  the
                     Pentagon 128k  and similar machines is the display timing
                     details.

              Spectrum SE
                     A recent  variant  designed  by  Andrew  Owen  and  Jarek
                     Adamski,  which  is  possibly  best thought of as a cross
                     between the 128K machine and the Timex variants, allowing
                     272K  of RAM to be accessed. Some more details are avail-
                     able     at     http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/refer-
                     ence/sereference.htm  and  documentation  of the extended
                     BASIC is available  at  https://github.com/cheveron/seba-

       Machine, Debugger...
              Start the monitor/debugger. See the MONITOR/DEBUGGER section for
              more information.

       Machine, Poke Finder...
              Start  the  `poke  finder'. See the POKE FINDER section for more
              information.

       Machine, Poke Memory...
              Allow one to use multiface POKEs for  things  such  as  infinite
              lives. See the POKE MEMORY section for more information.

       Machine, Memory Browser...
              Start  the memory browser. It should be fairly obvious what this
              does; perhaps the only thing worth noting is that  emulation  is
              paused until you close the window.

       Machine, NMI
              Sends  a non-maskable interrupt to the emulated Spectrum. Due to
              a typo in the standard 48K ROM, this will  cause  a  reset,  but
              modified ROMs are available which make use of this feature. When
              the +D (or DISCiPLE) is emulated, this is used to access the  +D
              (or  DISCiPLE)'s  screenshot  and  snapshot features (see the +D
              EMULATION and DISCIPLE EMULATION sections below).  For the  DIS-
              CiPLE, Caps Shift must be held down whilst pressing the NMI but-
              ton.  For some UIs, this may be tricky, or  even  impossible  to
              do.   Note that GDOS on the DISCiPLE contains a bug which causes
              corruption of saved snapshots, and a failure to return from  the
              NMI menu correctly.  This bug is not present in G+DOS on the +D.

       Machine, Multiface Red Button
              Presses  the Multiface One/128/3 red button to active the inter-
              face.

       Machine, Didaktik SNAP
              Presses the Didaktik 80 (or Didaktik 40)'s `SNAP' button.

       F7
       Media, Tape, Open...
              Choose a PZX, TAP or TZX virtual-tape file to load from. See the
              FILE  SELECTION  section  below for details on how to choose the
              file. If Auto-load media is set in the Media Options dialog  (as
              it  is  by  default), you may use the File, Open...  menu option
              instead, and the tape will begin loading automatically.   Other-
              wise,  you  have to start the load in the emulated machine (with
              LOAD "" or the 128's Tape Loader option, though you may need  to
              reset first).

              To  guarantee  that  TZX  files  will  load properly, you should
              select the file, make sure tape-loading traps  are  disabled  in
              the  Media  Options  dialog,  then  press F8 (or do Media, Tape,
              Play).  That said, most TZXs will work with  tape-loading  traps
              enabled  (often  quickly  loading partway, then loading the rest
              real-time), so you might want to try it that way first.

       F8
       Media, Tape, Play
              Start playing the PZX, TAP or TZX file, if  required.  (Choosing
              the option (or pressing F8) again pauses playback, and a further
              press resumes). To explain -- if tape-loading  traps  have  been
              disabled  (in  the  Media  Options dialog), starting the loading
              process in the emulated machine isn't enough. You also  have  to
              `press  play', so to speak :-), and this is how you do that. You
              may also need to `press play' like this in certain other circum-
              stances,  e.g. TZXs containing multi-load games may have a stop-
              the-tape request (which Fuse obeys).

       Media, Tape, Browse
              Browse through the current tape. A brief display of each of  the
              data  blocks on the current tape will appear, from which you can
              select which block Fuse will play next. With the GTK+ UI, emula-
              tion will continue while the browser is displayed; double-click-
              ing on a block will select it. In the other  UIs,  emulation  is
              paused and you can use the cursor keys and press Enter to select
              it. If you decide you don't want to  change  block,  just  press
              Escape.

       Media, Tape, Rewind
              Rewind  the  current  virtual tape, so it can be read again from
              the beginning.

       Media, Tape, Clear
              Clear the current virtual tape. This is particularly useful when
              you  want  a  `clean  slate' to add newly-saved files to, before
              doing Media, Tape, Write...  (or F6).

       F6
       Media, Tape, Write...
              Write the current virtual-tape contents to a TZX file. You  will
              be  prompted  for  a filename. The virtual-tape contents are the
              contents of the previously-loaded tape (if any has  been  loaded
              since  you  last did a Media, Tape, Clear), followed by anything
              you've saved from the emulated machine since.  These newly-saved
              files  are  not  written  to any tape file until you choose this
              option!

       Media, Tape, Record Start
              Starts directly recording the output from the emulated  Spectrum
              to  the  current  virtual-tape.  This is useful when you want to
              record using a non-standard ROM or from a custom  save  routine.
              Most tape operations are disabled during recording. Stop record-
              ing with the Media, Tape, Write...  menu option.

       Media, Tape, Record Stop
              Stops the direct recording and places the new recording into the
              virtual-tape.

       Media, Interface 1
              Virtual  Microdrive  images  are accessible only when the Inter-
              face 1 is active from the Options, Peripherals, General...  dia-
              log.  Note  that any changes to the Microdrive image will not be
              written to the file on disk until the appropriate save option is
              used.

       Media, Interface 1, Microdrive 1, Insert New
              Insert  a  new  (unformatted) Microdrive cartridge into emulated
              Microdrive 1.

       Media, Interface 1, Microdrive 1, Insert...
              Insert an existing  Microdrive  cartridge  image  into  emulated
              Microdrive 1. You will be prompted for a filename.

       Media, Interface 1, Microdrive 1, Eject
              Eject  the  Microdrive  image  in Microdrive 1. If the image has
              been modified, you will be asked as  to  whether  you  want  any
              changes saved.

       Media, Interface 1, Microdrive 1, Save
              Save the Microdrive image in Microdrive 1.

       Media, Interface 1, Microdrive 1, Save as...
              Write  the  Microdrive image in Microdrive 1 to a file. You will
              be prompted for a filename.

       Media, Interface 1, Microdrive 1, Write protect, Enable
              Enable the write protect tab for the image in Microdrive 1.

       Media, Interface 1, Microdrive 1, Write protect, Disable

       Media, Disk
              Virtual  floppy  disk images are accessible when emulating a +3,
              +3e, Pentagon or Scorpion, or when the Beta 128, Opus Discovery,
              +D,  Didaktik  or  DISCiPLE  interface options are enabled and a
              machine compatible with the chosen interface is  selected.  (See
              THE  .DSK  FORMAT, BETA 128 EMULATION, OPUS DISCOVERY EMULATION,

KEY MAPPINGS
       When emulating the Spectrum, keys F1 to F10 are used as  shortcuts  for
       various  menu  items,  as described above. The alphanumeric keys (along
       with Enter and Space) are mapped as-is to the Spectrum keys. The  other
       key mappings are:

       Shift  emulated as Caps Shift

       Control, Alt, and Meta
              emulated  as  Symbol Shift (most other modifiers are also mapped
              to this)

       Backspace
              emulated as Caps-0 (Delete)

       Esc    emulated as Caps-1 (Edit)

       Caps Lock
              emulated as Caps-2

       Cursor keys
              emulated as Caps-5/6/7/8 (as appropriate)

       Tab    emulated as Caps Shift-Symbol Shift (Extended Mode)

       Some further punctuation keys are supported, if they exist on your key-
       board  -- `,', `.', `/', `;', `'', `#', `-', and `='.  These are mapped
       to the appropriate symbol-shifted keys on the Spectrum.

       A list of keys applicable when using  the  file  selection  dialogs  is
       given in the FILE SELECTION section below.

DISPLAY SIZE
       Some  of  Fuse's UIs allow resizing of the emulated Spectrum's display.
       For the window-based ones (GTK+, Win32 and Xlib), you  can  resize  the
       window  by,  well,  resizing  it. :-) Exactly how this works depends on
       your window manager; you may have to make the  window  over  twice  the
       width  and  height  of  the original size before it actually scales up.
       Fuse attempts to keep the window `square', but with  some  window  man-
       agers this can mean the window will never resize at all. If you experi-
       ence this problem, the `--no-aspect-hint' option may help.

       If you're using the SDL UI under X11 or GTK+, the window will automati-
       cally resize to be the correct size for the graphics filter selected.

GRAPHICS FILTERS
       Fuse  has  the  ability  to apply essentially arbitrary filters between
       building its image of the Spectrum's screen, and displaying it  on  the
       emulating  machine's  monitor.  These filters can be used to do various
       forms of smoothing, emulation of TV scanlines and various other  possi-
       bilities.  Support  for  graphics  filters varies between the different
       user interfaces, but there are two general classes:  the  GTK+,  Win32,
       Xlib,  SVGAlib  and SDL user interfaces (and the saving of .png screen-
       shots) support `interpolating' filters which use a palette larger  than
       the  Spectrum's  16 colours,  while the framebuffer user interface cur-
       rently does not support filters at all.

       A further complication arises due to the fact that the  Timex  machines
       have their high-resolution video mode with twice the horizontal resolu-
       tion. To deal with this, Fuse treats these machines as having  a  `nor-
       mal'  display  size  which  is  twice  the  size of a normal Spectrum's
       screen, leading to a different set of filters being available for these
       machines.  Note  that  any  of  the double or triple-sizing filters are
       available for Timex machines only when using the  SDL,  Win32  or  GTK+
       user interfaces.

       The  available filters, along with their short name used to select them
       from the command line, are:

       Timex half (smoothed) (half)
       Timex half (skipping) (halfskip)
              Two Timex-machine specific filters which scale the  screen  down
              to  half normal (Timex) size; that is, the same size as a normal
              Spectrum screen. The difference between these two filters is  in
              how they handle the high-resolution mode: the `smoothed' version
              is an interpolating filter which averages pairs of adjacent pix-
              els,  while the `skipping' version is a non-interpolating filter
              which simply drops every other pixel.

       Normal (normal)
              The simplest filter: just display one pixel for every  pixel  on
              the Spectrum's screen.

       Double size (2x)
              Scale the displayed screen up to double size.

       Triple size (3x)
              Scale  the  displayed  screen  up to triple size. Available only
              with the GTK+, Win32, Xlib and SDL user interfaces or when  sav-
              ing screenshots of non-Timex machines.

       Quadruple size (4x)
              Scale  the displayed screen up to quadruple size. Available only
              with the GTK+, Win32 and SDL user interfaces.

       2xSaI (2xsai)
       Super 2xSaI (super2xsai)
       SuperEagle (supereagle)
              Three  interpolating  filters  which  apply  successively   more
              smoothing. All three double the size of the displayed screen.

       AdvMAME2x (advmame2x)
              A  double-sizing,  non-interpolating  filter  which  attempts to
              smooth diagonal lines.

       AdvMAME3x (advmame3x)
              Very similar to AdvMAME2x, except that it triples  the  size  of
              the  displayed screen. Available only with the GTK+, Win32, Xlib
              and SDL user interfaces or when saving screenshots of  non-Timex
              machines.

       TV 2x (tv2x)
       TV 3x (tv3x)
       TV 4x (tv4x)
       Timex TV (timextv)
              Four  filters  which attempt to emulate the effect of television
              scanlines. The first is a  double-sizing  filter  for  non-Timex
              machines,  the  second  is  a  similar triple-sizing filter, the
              third is a similar quadruple-sizing filter, while the last is  a
              single-sizing  filter  for  Timex machines (note that this means
              TV 2X and Timex TV produce the same size output).

       PAL TV (paltv)
       PAL TV 2x (paltv2x)
       PAL TV 3x (paltv3x)
              Three filters which attempt to emulate the effect of the PAL  TV
              system which layers a lower-resolution colour image over the top
              of a higher-resolution black-and-white image.  The  filters  can
              also optionally add scanlines like the other TV series scalers.

       Dot matrix (dotmatrix)
              A double-sizing filter which emulates the effect of a dot-matrix
              display.

       Timex 1.5x (timex15x)
              An interpolating Timex-specific filter which  scales  the  Timex
              screen up to 1.5x its usual size (which is therefore 3x the size
              of a `normal' Spectrum screen). Available  only  for  the  GTK+,
              Win32 and SDL user interfaces or when saving screenshots.

       Timex 2x (timex2x)
              A non-interpolating Timex-specific filter which scales the Timex
              screen up to 2x its usual size (which is therefore 4x  the  size
              of  a  `normal'  Spectrum  screen). Available only for the GTK+,
              Win32 and SDL user interfaces or when saving screenshots.

       HQ 2x (hq2x)
       HQ 3x (hq3x)
       HQ 4x (hq4x)
              Three filters which do high  quality  (but  slow)  antialiasing.
              Doubles  and  triples  and  quadruples the size of the displayed
              screen respectively.

THE EMULATED SPECTRUM
       The emulated Spectrum is, by default, an unmodified 48K Spectrum with a
       tape  player  and  ZX Printer attached. Oh, and apparently some magical
       snapshot load/save machine which is probably best glossed over for  the
       sake of the analogy. :-)

       To  emulate  different kinds of Spectrum, select the Machine, Select...
       menu option, or press F9.

       The Spectrum emulation is paused when any dialogs appear. In the widget
       UI, it's also paused when menus or the keyboard picture are displayed.

PRINTER EMULATION
       The  various  models  of  Spectrum supported a range of ways to connect
       printers, three of which are supported by Fuse. Different printers  are
       made available for the different models:

       16, 48, TC2048, TC2068, TS2068
              ZX Printer

       128/+2/Pentagon
              Serial printer (text-only)

       +2A, +3
              Parallel printer (text-only)

       If  Opus Discovery, +D or DISCiPLE emulation is in use and printer emu-
       lation is enabled, text-only emulation of the disk interface's parallel
       printer interface is provided.

       Any  printout  is  appended to one (or both) of two files, depending on
       the printer -- these default  to  printout.txt  for  text  output,  and
       printout.pbm for graphics (PBM images are supported by most image view-
       ers and converters). These names can be changed with the --textfile and
       --graphicsfile  options  from  the  command line or configuration file.
       While the ZX Printer can only output graphically, simulated text output
       is  generated  at  the same time using a crude sort of OCR based on the
       current character set (a bit like using SCREEN$). There is currently no
       support  for graphics when using the serial/parallel output, though any
       escape codes used will be `printed' faithfully. (!)

       By the way, it's not a good idea to modify the printout.pbm  file  out-
       side  of Fuse if you want to continue appending to it. The header needs
       to have a certain layout for Fuse to be able to continue  appending  to
       it  correctly, and the file will be overwritten if it can't be appended
       to.

ZXATASP AND ZXCF
       The ZXATASP and ZXCF interfaces are two peripherals  designed  by  Sami
       Vehmaa  which  significantly  extend  the capabilities of the Spectrum.
       More  details   on   both   are   available   from   Sami's   homepage,
       http://user.tninet.se/~vjz762w/, but a brief overview is given here.

       The  real ZXATASP comes with either 128K or 512K of RAM and the ability
       to connect an IDE hard disks and a CompactFlash card,  while  the  ZXCF
       comes with 128K, 512K or 1024K of RAM and the ability to connect a Com-
       pactFlash card. From an emulation point of view, the two interfaces are
       actually  very  similar as a CompactFlash card is logically just an IDE
       hard disk. Currently, Fuse's emulation is fixed at having 512K  of  RAM
       in the ZXATASP and 1024K in the ZXCF.

       To  activate  the  ZXATASP,  simply select the ZXATASP interface option
       from the Options, Peripherals, Disk...  dialog. The state of the upload
       and  write protect jumpers is then controlled by the ZXATASP upload and
       ZXATASP write protect options. Similarly, the ZXCF is controlled by the
       ZXCF interface and ZXCF upload options (the ZXCF write protect is soft-
       ware controlled).

       If you're using either the ZXATASP or ZXCF, you almost  certainly  want
       to  investigate ResiDOS, the operating system designed for use with the
       ZXATASP and ZXCF. ResiDOS provides facilities for using the extra  RAM,
       accessing  the  mass storage devices and a task manager allowing virtu-
       ally  instant  switching  between  programs  on   the   Spectrum.   See
       http://www.worldofspectrum.org/residos/ for more details.

DIVIDE
       The  DivIDE  is  another  IDE interface for the Spectrum, of which full
       details       can       be        found        at        http://web.ar-
       chive.org/web/20150302052256/http://baze.au.com/divide/.  The interface
       can be activated via the DivIDE  interface  option  from  the  Options,
       Peripherals, Disk...  dialog, and the state of its write protect jumper
       controlled via the DivIDE write protect option.  If you're going to  be
       using  the  DivIDE, you'll probably want one of the firmwares available
       from the DivIDE homepage.

DIVMMC
       The DivMMC is a MMC interface for the Spectrum. Originally designed  by
       Alessandro Dorigatti for the V6Z80P+ FPGA board as the fusion of DivIDE
       and ZXMMC+ interfaces, later assembled as an interface for  real  spec-
       trums  by  Mario Prato. Currently there are variants with different RAM
       size, one/two memory cards slots, optional kempston jostick, etc.

       The interface can be activated via the DivMMC interface option from the
       Options,  Peripherals,  Disk...   dialog,  and  the state of its EEPROM
       write protect jumper controlled via the DivMMC  write  protect  option.
       If  you're going to be using the DivMMC, you'll need to load the ESXDOS
       firmware at http://www.esxdos.org/ or use the ZX Spectrum +3e  ROMs  by
       Garry Lancaster.

       You'll  also need a HDF image to store the contents of the memory card.
       There are several tools to create  and  manipulate  this  file  format,
       e.g., hdfmonkey at https://github.com/gasman/hdfmonkey.

SPECTRANET EMULATION
       The  Spectranet is an Ethernet network interface for the ZX Spectrum by
       Dylan Thomas. The interface can be activated via the Spectranet  option
       on  the  Peripherals preferences dialog, and the state of its automatic
       page-in (disable) jumper controlled via the Spectranet disable  option.
       If you're going to be using the Spectranet, you'll probably want one of
       the firmwares available  from  the  Spectranet  homepage  (http://spec-
       trum.alioth.net/doc/index.php)  which  is  also where you can find more
       information on using the interface.

       Installing the Spectranet firmware on Fuse is slightly more complicated
       than on a real machine, mostly because Fuse's emulation doesn't support
       DHCP. These instructions are correct as  of  2012-01-26  --  if  you're
       using a later firmware than this, things may have changed slightly.

       The  first  thing  you will need to do is to obtain a copy of the Spec-
       tranet installer as a .tap file (or similar).  The  installer  is  also
       available at the Spectranet site above.

       Once  you  have  a copy of the installer, start Fuse and tick the Spec-
       tranet option from the Options, Peripherals,  General...   dialog,  and
       the  state  of  its  write protect jumper controlled via the Spectranet
       disable option. Once that's done, open  the  installer  file  (use  the
       Media,  Tape,  Open...   command  rather than File, Open...  to prevent
       autoloading) and enter the following commands from BASIC:

       CLEAR 26999
       LOAD "" CODE
       RANDOMIZE USR 27000

       The screen should turn blue and you'll see around 20 lines  of  message
       appearing  as  the firmware is installed, starting with "Erasing sector
       0" and finishing with "Restoring page B", and you'll get  the  familiar
       0 OK, 0: 1 at the bottom of the screen.

       Now untick the Spectranet disable option from the Options, Peripherals,
       General...  dialog and reset the Spectrum. You should see a very  brief
       blue  status  screen,  before the regular copyright screen appears with
       some Spectranet information at the top -- there should be  four  status
       lines,  starting  with  "Alioth  Spectranet"  and ending with the Spec-
       tranet's IP address (which will be 255.255.255.255 at this stage).

       Now trigger an NMI (the Machine / NMI menu option) and you should get a
       white on blue Spectranet NMI menu with five options.

       Select  [A]  Configure  network  settings  --  this  should lead you to
       another menu, which will scroll of the top of the screen;  don't  worry
       about this for now.

       You'll now need to set various options:

       [A] Enable/disable DHCP -- select N
       [B]  Change  IP  address -- enter the IP address of the machine you are
       running Fuse on.
       [C] Change netmask -- enter the appropriate netmask for the IP  address
       you  selected  above.  If  that  doesn't  mean  anything  to  you,  try
       255.255.255.0
       [D] Change default gateway -- enter the  appropriate  gateway  address.
       If you don't know any better, enter the IP address of your router.
       [E]  Change primary DNS -- enter the address of your DNS server. If you
       don't know any better, use Google's public DNS server, 8.8.8.8.

       There is no need to change options [F] or [G], but do select:

       [H] Change hostname -- enter  a  hostname  for  the  Spectranet-enabled
       machine.  It  doesn't  really matter what you enter here -- it's mostly
       useful just to replace the junk default name so you can see what you've
       entered for the other settings.

       Your screen should now look something like this:

       Current configuration
       ---------------------------------------
       Use DHCP           : No
       IP address         : 192.168.000.002
       Netmask            : 255.255.255.000
       Default gateway    : 192.168.000.001
       Primary DNS        : 192.168.000.001
       Secondary DNS      : 255.255.255.255
       Hardware address   : FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
       Hostname           : fuse
       <menu options>

       If  everything  looks correct, select [I] Save changes and exit (you'll
       see a brief "Saving configuration..." message) followed by [E] Exit, at
       which point you'll be returned to BASIC.

       Now type the following commands:

       %cfgnew
       %cfgcommit

       Which will show the standard 0 OK, 0:1 at the bottom of the screen.

       Reset  the Spectrum again and you'll see the same four line status dis-
       play, but this time with your IP address on the last line.

       Congratulations! You have now installed  the  Spectranet  firmware.  To
       save  having  to  go through all that every time you start Fuse, save a
       .szx snapshot at this point, and load that in every time  you  want  to
       use the Spectranet.

FILE SELECTION
       The  way  you  select a file (whether snapshot or tape file) depends on
       which UI you're using. So firstly, here's how  to  use  the  GTK+  file
       selector.

       The  selector  shows the directories and files in the current directory
       in two separate subwindows. If either list is too big  to  fit  in  the
       window,  you  can  use  the  scrollbar to see the rest (by dragging the
       slider, for example), or you can use Shift-Tab (to  move  the  keyboard
       focus  to  a  subwindow) and use the cursor keys.  To change directory,
       double-click it.

       To choose a file to load you can either double-click it,  or  click  it
       then click Ok.  Or click Cancel to abort.

       If  you're  using  the  keyboard,  probably  the easiest way to use the
       selector is to just ignore it and type in the name. This isn't as  irk-
       some as it sounds, since the filename input box has filename completion
       -- type part of a directory or file name, then press  Tab.   It  should
       complete  it. If it was a directory, it moves to that directory; if the
       completion was ambiguous, it completes as much as possible, and narrows
       the  filenames  shown to those which match. You should press Enter when
       you've finished typing the filename, or Esc to abort.

       Now, if you're using the widget UI -- the one using the  Spectrum  font
       --  the selector works a bit differently. The files and directories are
       all listed in a single  two-column-wide  window  (the  directories  are
       shown at the top, ending in `/') -- the names may be truncated onscreen
       if they're too long to fit.

       To move the cursor, you can either use the cursor keys, or the Spectrum
       equivalents  5/6/7/8,  or (similarly) h/j/k/l. For faster movement, the
       Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End keys are supported and do what  you'd
       expect.  To  select  a file or directory, press Enter.  To abort, press
       Esc.

       With both selectors, do bear in mind that all files are shown,  whether
       Fuse would be able to load them or not.

MONITOR/DEBUGGER
       Firstly,  note  that  the vast majority of this section applies only if
       you're using the GTK+ user interface; if you're using one of the widget
       user  interfaces,  you'll get a very basic monitor which shows the cur-
       rent values of the registers and allows you to single step through exe-
       cution or continue.

       If  you  are  using the GTK+ user interface, Fuse features a moderately
       powerful, completely transparent monitor/debugger, which can  be  acti-
       vated via the Machine, Debugger...  menu option. A debugger window will
       appear, showing the current state of the emulated machine: the top-left
       `pane' shows the current state of the Z80 and the last bytes written to
       any emulated peripherals. The bottom-left pane lists any active  break-
       points. Moving right, the next pane shows where the Spectrum's 64K mem-
       ory map (the `W?'  and `C?'  indicate whether each displayed  chunk  is
       writable or contended respectively).  Fuse tracks the memory mapping of
       the overall address space in 2KB chunks but will summarise  the  mapped
       pages  where  they  are  part of the same page of the underlying memory
       source (e.g. 8KB page sizes in the Spectrum 128K and 4KB pages  in  the
       Timex clones' DOCK and EXROM banks).

       The  next  pane to the right has a disassembly, which by default starts
       at the current program counter, although this can be modified either by
       the `disassemble' command (see below) or by dragging the scrollbar next
       to it. The next pane shows the current stack, and the  final  pane  any
       `events'  which  are  due  to  occur and could affect emulation. Any of
       these panes can be removed by use of the View menu. Below the  displays
       are  an  entry box for debugger commands, and five buttons for control-
       ling the debugger:

       Evaluate
              Evaluate the command currently in the entry box.

       Single Step
              Run precisely one Z80 opcode and then stop emulation again.

       Continue
              Restart emulation, but leave the debugger window open. Note that
              the  debugger window will not be updated while emulation is run-
              ning.

       Break
              Stop emulation and return to the debugger.

       Close
              Close the debugger window and restart emulation.

       Double-clicking on an entry in the stack pane will cause  emulation  to
       run until the program counter reaches the value stored at that address,
       while double-clicking on an entry in the `events' pane will cause  emu-
       lation to run until that time is reached.

       The  main  power  of  the debugger is via the commands entered into the
       entry box, which are similar in nature (but definitely not identical to
       or  as  powerful  as)  to those in gdb(1).  In general, the debugger is
       case-insensitive, and numbers will be interpreted  as  decimal,  unless
       prefixed  by  either  `0x' or `$' when they will be interpreted as hex.
       Each command can be abbreviated to the portion not in curly braces.

       ba{se} number
              Change the debugger window to displaying output in base  number.
              Available values are 10 (decimal) or 16 (hex).

       br{eakpoint} [address] [if condition]
              Set  a  breakpoint  to stop emulation and return to the debugger
              whenever an opcode is executed at address and  condition  evalu-
              ates  true.  If  address  is omitted, it defaults to the current
              value of PC.

       br{eakpoint} p{ort} (re{ad}|w{rite}) port [if condition]
              Set a breakpoint to trigger whenever IO port port is  read  from
              or written to and condition evaluates true.

       br{eakpoint} (re{ad}|w{rite}) [address] [if condition]
              Set  a breakpoint to trigger whenever memory location address is
              read from (other than via an opcode fetch)  or  written  to  and
              condition evaluates true.  Address again defaults to the current
              value of PC if omitted.

       br{eakpoint} ti{me} time [if condition]
              Set a breakpoint to occur time tstates after the  start  of  the
              every  frame,  assuming  condition  evaluates  true  (if  one is
              given).

       br{eakpoint} ev{ent} area:detail [if condition]
              Set  a  breakpoint  to  occur  when  the  event   specified   by
              area:detail  occurs  and condition evaluates to true. The events
              which can be caught are:

              beta128:page
              beta128:unpage
                     The Beta 128 interface is paged into  or  out  of  memory
                     respectively.
              didaktik80:page
              didaktik80:unpage
                     The  Didaktik 80 interface is paged into or out of memory
                     respectively.
              disciple:page
              disciple:unpage
                     The DISCiPLE interface is paged into  or  out  of  memory
                     respectively.

                     respectively.
              divmmc:page
              divmmc:unpage
                     The DivIDE interface is  paged  into  or  out  of  memory
                     respectively.
              if1:page
              if1:unpage
                     The  Interface 1  shadow ROM is paged into or out of mem-
                     ory.
              multiface:page
              multiface:unpage
                     The Multiface One/128/3 is paged into or  out  of  memory
                     respectively.
              opus:page
              opus:unpage
                     The Opus Discovery is paged into or out of memory respec-
                     tively.
              plusd:page
              plusd:unpage

                     The Spectranet interface is paged into or out of memory.
              tape:play
              tape:stop
                     The emulated tape starts or stops playing.
              zxatasp:page
              zxatasp:unpage
                     The ZXATASP interface is paged into or out of memory.
              zxcf:page
              zxcf:unpage
                     The ZXCF interface is paged into or out of memory.

              In  all cases, the event can be specified as area:* to catch all
              events from that area.

       cl{ear} [address]
              Remove all breakpoints at address or the current value of PC  if
              address is omitted. Port read/write breakpoints are unaffected.

       com{mmands} id <newline>
       <debugger command> <newline>
       <debugger command> <newline>
       ...
       end
              Set  things  such  that  the specified debugger commands will be
              automatically executed when breakpoint id is triggered. There is
              currently  no  user  interface  for entering multi-line debugger
              commands, so the only way to specify this command is on the com-
              mand-line via the --debugger-command option.

       cond{ition} id [condition]
              Set  breakpoint  id  to  trigger only when condition is true, or
              unconditionally if condition is omitted.

       co{ntinue}
              Equivalent to the Continue button.

       del{ete} [id]
              Remove breakpoint id, or all breakpoints if id is omitted.

       di{sassemble} address
              Set the centre panel disassembly to begin at address.

       ex{it} [expression]
              Exit the emulator immediately, using  the  exit  code  resulting
              from  the  evaluation of expression, or 0 if expression is omit-
              ted.

       fi{nish}
              Exit from the current CALL or equivalent. This isn't infallible:
              it  works  by setting a temporary breakpoint at the current con-
              tents of the stack pointer, so will not  function  correctly  if
              the  code returns to some other point or plays with its stack in
              other ways. Also, setting this breakpoint doesn't disable  other
              breakpoints,  which  may  trigger before this one. In that case,
              the temporary breakpoint remains, and the `continue' command can
              be used to return to it.

       i{gnore} id count
              Do  not  trigger  the  next count times that breakpoint id would
              have triggered.

       n{ext}
              Step to the opcode following the current one. As with the  `fin-
              ish'  command,  this  works by setting a temporary breakpoint at
              the next opcode, so is not infallible.

       o{ut} port value
              Write value to IO port port.

       pr{int} expression
              Print the value of expression to standard output.

       se{t} address value
              Poke value into memory at address.

       se{t} $variable value
              Set the value of the debugger variable variable to value.

       se{t} area:detail value
              Set the value of the system variable area:detail to value.   The
              available system variables are listed below.

       s{tep}
              Equivalent to the Single Step button.

       t{breakpoint} [options]
              This  is  the  same  as  the `breakpoint' command in its various
              forms, except that the breakpoint is temporary: it will  trigger
              once and once only, and then be removed.

       Addresses  can  be  specified  in  one of two forms: either an absolute
       addresses, specified by an integer in the range 0x0000 to 0xFFFF or  as
       a  `source:page:offset'  combination, which refers to a location offset
       bytes into memory bank page, independent of where  that  bank  is  cur-
       rently  paged  into  memory.  RAM  and ROM pages are indicated, respec-
       tively, by `RAM' and `ROM' sources (e.g.  offset  0x1234  in  ROM 1  is
       specified as `ROM:1:0x1234').  Other available sources are: `Betadisk',
       `Didaktik 80 RAM', `Didaktik 80 ROM', `DISCiPLE RAM',  `DISCiPLE  ROM',
       `DivIDE  EPROM',  `DivIDE  RAM',  `DivMMC  EPROM', `DivMMC RAM', `If1',
       `If2', `Multiface RAM', `Multiface ROM', `Opus RAM', `Opus ROM', `PlusD
       RAM',  `PlusD  ROM',  `SpeccyBoot',  `Spectranet', `Timex Dock', `Timex
       EXROM', `uSource', `ZXATASP' and `ZXCF'.  Please, note that  spaces  in
       memory    sources    should    be    escaped,   e.g.,   `break   Didak-
       tik\ 80\ ROM:0:0x1234'.  The 48K machines are treated as having a  per-
       manent  mapping  of  page 5  at  0x4000, page 2 at 0x8000 and page 0 at
       0xC000; the 16K Spectrum is treated as having page 5 at 0x4000  and  no
       page at 0x8000 and 0xC000.

       Anywhere  the  debugger  is  expecting a numeric value, except where it
       expects a breakpoint id, you can  instead  use  a  numeric  expression,
       which  uses a restricted version of C's syntax; exactly the same syntax
       is used for conditional breakpoints, with `0' being false and any other
       value being true. In numeric expressions, you can use integer constants
       (all calculations are done in  integers),  system  variables,  debugger
       variables, parentheses, the standard four numeric operations (`+', `-',
       `*' and `/'), the (non-)equality operators `==' and `!=', the  compari-
       son  operators `>', `<', `>=' and `<=', bitwise and (`&'), or (`|') and
       exclusive or (`^') and logical and (`&&') and or (`||').  Square brack-
       ets  (`['  and  `]')  can  be  used to dereference a value; for example
       `[0x4000]' will give the value of the first byte of the screen.

       System variables are specified via an `area:detail' syntax. The  avail-
       able system variables are:

       ay:current
              The current AY-3-8912 register.
       divmmc:control
              The last byte written to DivMMC control port.
       spectrum:frames
              The frame count since reset. Note that this variable can only be
              read, not written to.
       tape:microphone
              The current level of the tape input connected to the `EAR' port.
              Note that this variable can only be read, not written to.
       ula:last
              The  last  byte  written to the ULA. Note that this variable can
              only be read, not written to.
       ula:mem1ffd
              The last byte written to memory control  port  used  by  the  ZX
              Spectrum +2A/3; normally addressed at 0x1ffd, hence the name.
       ula:mem7ffd
              The last byte written to primary memory control port used by the
              ZX Spectrum 128 and later; normally addressed at  0x7ffd,  hence
              the name.
       ula:tstates
              The number of tstates since the last interrupt.
       z80: register name
              The  value  of  the specified register. Both 8-bit registers and
              16-bit register pairs are supported. The MEMPTR / WZ hidden reg-
              ister  is  also supported. The (presumable) Q hidden register is
              also supported.
       z80:im
              The current interrupt mode of the Z80.
       z80:iff1
       z80:iff2
              1 if the specified interrupt flip-flop is currently set, or 0 if
              it is not set.

THE POKE FINDER
       The `poke finder' is a tool which is designed to make the task of find-
       ing (infinite lives etc.) pokes for games a bit easier: it  is  similar
       to  the `Lifeguard' utility which was available for use with the Multi-
       face. It works by maintaining a list of locations in which the  current
       number  of lives (etc.) may be stored, and having the ability to remove
       from that list any locations which don't contain a specified value.

       The poke finder dialog contains an entry box for specifying  the  value
       to be searched for, a count of the current number of possible locations
       and, if there are less than 20 possible locations, a list of the possi-
       ble  locations  (in `page:offset' format). The five buttons act as fol-
       lows:

       Incremented
              Remove from the list of possible locations all  addresses  which
              have not been incremented since the last search.

       Decremented
              Remove  from  the list of possible locations all addresses which
              have not been decremented since the last search.

       Search
              Remove from the list of possible locations all  addresses  which
              do not contain the value specified in the `Search for' field.

       Reset
              Reset  the poke finder so that all locations are considered pos-
              sible.

       Close
              Close the dialog. Note that this  does  not  reset  the  current
              state of the poke finder.

       Double-clicking  on  an  entry  in  the list of possible locations will
       cause a breakpoint to be set to trigger whenever that location is writ-
       ten to.

       An  example of how to use this may make things a bit clearer. We'll use
       the 128K version of Gryzor. Load the game,  define  keys  to  suit  and
       start  playing. Immediately pause the game and bring up the poke finder
       dialog. We note that we currently have 6 lives, so enter `6'  into  the
       `Search  for' field and click `Search'. This reduces the number of pos-
       sible locations to around 931 (you may get a slightly different  number
       depending  on  exactly  when you paused the game). Play along a bit and
       then (deliberately) lose a life. Pause the game again. As we  now  have
       5 lives, replace the `6' in the `Search for' field with a `5' and click
       `Search' again. This then reduces the list  of  possible  locations  to
       just  one:  page 2,  offset 0x00BC. This is the only location in memory
       which stored `6' when we had 6 lives and `5' when we  had  5 lives,  so
       its pretty likely that this is where the lives count is stored. Double-
       clicking on the `2:0x00BC' entry in the dialog will set the appropriate
       breakpoint  (you may wish to open the debugger at this point to confirm
       this). Play along a bit more. When you next lose a life,  emulation  is
       stopped  with  PC at 0x91CD. Scrolling up a few addresses in the debug-
       ger's disassembly pane shows a value was loaded from 0x80BC (our  hypo-
       thetical  lives  counter), decremented and then stored again to 0x80BC,
       which looks very much like the code to reduce the number of  lives.  We
       can  now  use  the  debugger  to replace the decrement with a NOP (`set
       0x91c9 0'), and playing the game some more after this reveals that this
       has worked and we now have infinite lives.

THE POKE MEMORY
       Fuse  supports  multiface  POKEs,  allowing  to  modify specific memory
       addresses in order to cheat (infinite lives, infinite ammo, etc.).

       The `poke memory' dialog contains a list of recently loaded  POKEs  and
       some entry boxes for adding custom POKEs:

       Bank
              Sets  the  128K  memory  bank (values `0' to `7') or the current
              memory mapping (value `8' or blank).

       Address
              Memory address to modify. Values in range 16384 to 65535 for 48K
              memory  mode  or  0 to 65535 for 128K memory banks. GTK+ UI also
              accepts hex addresses.

       Value
              New value for the former address, in range 0 to 255.  Value  256
              means "Prompt to the user later".

       It  is  possible  to  load  POKEs from an external file using the File,
       Open...  menu option or the drag-and-drop functionality in the GTK+ and
       Win32 UIs.  After loading a snapshot or tape, Fuse will try to automat-
       ically locate a POK file with the same file name. This means that if we
       open   `GAME.TAP',   then   Fuse   will  try  to  open  `GAME.POK'  and
       `POKES/GAME.POK'. See http://www.worldofspectrum.org/POKformat.txt  for
       more details about this file format.

       POKEs  loaded  in  the list can be activated or deactivated as the user
       wants and will remain in memory until a machine reset.

THE .DSK FORMAT
       In general, disk images for the +3 Spectrum are thought of as being  in
       DSK  format.  However,  this  is  actually a slight oversimplification;
       there are in fact two similar, but not  identical,  DSK  formats.  (The
       difference  can  be  seen  by  doing `head -1 dskfile': one format will
       start `MV - CPCEMU' and the other will start `EXTENDED').

       Fuse supports both the `CPCEMU' and `EXTENDED' formats.

BETA 128 EMULATION
       Fuse supports Betadisk emulation in its Pentagon  and  Scorpion  emula-
       tion,  and  also under 48K, TC2048, 128K and +2 (but not +2A) emulation
       if the Beta 128 interface option from the Options, Peripherals, Disk...
       dialog  is enabled. When that option is used in 48K or TC2048 emulation
       the Beta 128 auto-boot in 48K  machines  option  additionally  controls
       whether the machine boots directly into the TR-DOS system. See the DISK
       FILE FORMATS section for more details on supported disk file formats.

OPUS DISCOVERY EMULATION
       By default,  Fuse  emulates  the  Opus  Discovery  interface  with  the
       optional  2k  RAM  expansion  and  a  second 40 track single sided disk
       drive.  See the DISK FILE FORMATS section for more details on supported
       disk  file  formats. The Opus Discovery's printer port is also emulated
       for output only. (See the PRINTER EMULATION section for more  details.)
       The  Opus Discovery may only be used with 16K, 48K, 128K, TC2048 and +2
       (not +2A) emulation.  To access disks, use the same  syntax  as  Inter-
       face 1 and Microdrives.

+D EMULATION
       Fuse supports emulating the +D disk and printer interface. See the DISK
       FILE FORMATS section for more details on supported disk  file  formats.
       The  +D's  printer port is emulated. (See the PRINTER EMULATION section
       for more details.) The +D may only be used with 48K, 128K and  +2  (not
       +2A) emulation.  To access disks, you will first need to load G+DOS, by
       inserting a disk containing the DOS file  (+SYS)  and  entering  "RUN".
       Once  DOS  is  loaded, you can load to/from +D disks by prefixing file-
       names with `dn' where `n' is the number of the drive in use.  For exam-
       ple, `LOAD d1"myfile"' would load the file named `myfile' from the emu-
       lated drive 1.  Microdrive syntax may also be used.

       To save a snapshot, choose the Machine, NMI menu option, and then press
       `4'  to save a 48K snapshot, or `5' to save a 128K snapshot.  When sav-
       ing a 128K snapshot, you must then press Y or N to indicate whether the
       screen  changed  while  saving the snapshot, to finish saving.  You can
       also choose `3' to save a  screenshot  to  disk.   Holding  Caps  Shift
       together  with  any  of  these options will cause the +D to save to the
       `other' drive to the one used last.

       Options `1' and `2' allow screenshots to be printed (in monochrome,  in
       normal and large formats respectively) if printer emulation is enabled.
       For saving and loading of snapshots, and saving of screenshots to disk,
       G+DOS  must  be  loaded  first, but printing of screenshots can be per-
       formed without loading G+DOS.

       Finally, `X' will return from the NMI menu.

DIDAKTIK 80 EMULATION
       Fuse supports Didaktik 80 (and Didaktik 40) emulation.  It emulates the
       original  version  of the Didaktik 80, running MDOS 1 and with a WD2797
       floppy controller.  See the DISK FILE FORMATS section for more  details
       on  supported disk file formats.  The Didaktik 80 may only be used with
       16K, 48K and TC2048 emulation.  To press the Didaktik 80's `SNAP'  but-
       ton, choose the Machine, Didaktik SNAP menu option.

DISCIPLE EMULATION
       Fuse  supports  emulating  the  DISCiPLE  disk  and  printer interface,
       although it does not currently support emulation of the  Sinclair  Net-
       work,  or  support  emulation of a DISCiPLE attached to a 128K machine.
       See the DISK FILE FORMATS section for more details  on  supported  disk
       file  formats,  which  are  the  same  as for +D emulation as described
       above. The DISCiPLE's printer port is emulated. (See the PRINTER EMULA-
       TION  section for more details.) The DISCiPLE may only be used with 48K
       emulation at present.  To access disks, you will  first  need  to  load
       GDOS,  by  inserting  a disk containing the DOS file (SYS) and entering
       "RUN".  Once DOS is loaded, you can load to/from DISCiPLE disks by pre-
       fixing filenames with `dn' where `n' is the number of the drive in use.
       For example, `LOAD d1"myfile"' would load the file named `myfile'  from
       the emulated drive 1.  Microdrive syntax may also be used.

       Snapshots  can  be  saved  in  a  similar  manner  to that of the +D as
       described above, but note that GDOS on  the  DISCiPLE  contains  a  bug
       which causes corruption as soon as the NMI button is pressed, affecting
       saving of snapshots, and also loading of snapshots that were originally
       saved  with  a  +D or SAM Coup.  This will cause corruption even when a
       screenshot is printed, or if the menu is  never  even  entered  in  the
       first  place  (due to Caps Shift not being pressed down, as is required
       for the DISCiPLE), provided that GDOS  is  loaded.   This  bug  is  not
       present in G+DOS on the +D.  (Note: this was caused by saving/restoring
       the AF register twice in the NMI handler, where both  AF  and  the  AF'
       shadow register should have been saved/restored.)

       The  NMI  button works slightly differently on the DISCiPLE than on the
       +D.  Caps Shift must be held down whilst pressing the NMI  button,  and
       there is no `X' option to exit the menu.  Also, printing of screenshots
       requires GDOS to be loaded.  Depending on the  UI  that  you're  using,
       holding  down  Caps  Shift whilst choosing the Machine, NMI menu option
       may be slightly tricky, or even impossible.  For the  GTK+  UI,  ensure
       that  the  Shift  key is held before entering on the Machine menu.  For
       the widget UI, it does not seem possible to perform this action.

DISK FILE FORMATS
       Fuse supports several disk image formats in its +D, Didaktik,  DISCiPLE
       and Beta 128 emulation.

       For reading:

       .UDI
              Ultra    Disk    Image;    for    specification    please    see
              http://faqwiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/UDI_format                    or
              http://zxmak.chat.ru/docs.htm

              This  is  the only image format which can store all the relevant
              information of the recorded data on a magnetic disk, so  it  can
              be  used  for  any  non  standard disk format. Fuse can read all
              extended track types too (mixed FM/MFM, or  tracks  with  `WEAK'
              data or even compressed tracks too).

       .FDI
              UKV Spectrum Debugger disk image format.

       .MGT .IMG
              DISCiPLE/+D file formats.

       .SAD
              For compatibility with SAM Coup disk images using these formats.
              Note that SAM Coup  `.DSK'  images  share  the  same  format  as
              `.MGT'.

       .D80 .D40
              Didaktik 80 and Didaktik 40 file formats.

       .TRD
              TR-DOS  disk  image. TRD and SCL sectors are loaded interleaved,
              therefore you might experience problems with  TR-DOS  ROMs  that
              use the turbo format (sequential sectors); for detailed informa-
              tion            please            see             http://web.ar-
              chive.org/web/20070808150548/http://www.ram-
              soft.bbk.org/tech/tr-info.zip

       .SCL
              A simple archive format for TR-DOS disk files. For specification
              please see http://www.zx-modules.de/fileformats/sclformat.html

       .TD0
              Teledisk image format; Fuse supports only files which do not use
              the "Advanced Compression" option. Detailed description found in
              http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/img54306/td0notes.txt     and
              https://web.ar-
              chive.org/web/20130116072335/http://www.fpns.net/willy/wteledsk.htm

       .DSK
              CPC disk image format; Fuse supports the plain old and  the  new
              extended  CPC format too. Further information please see the THE
              .DSK  FORMAT  section  and  the  CPCEMU  manual  section   7.7.1
              http://www.cpc-emu.org/linux/cpcemu_e.txt         or         the
              http://www.cpctech.org.uk/docs/extdsk.html

       .OPD .OPU
              Opus Discovery file formats.

       Fuse supports most of the above formats for  writing:  .UDI  .FDI  .MGT
       .IMG .SAD .D80 .D40 .TRD .SCL .OPD .OPU .DSK (only the old CPC format).

       You can save disk images with any output format, just select the appro-
       priate extension. (e.g.  `elite3.udi' to save as an UDI file).  If  the
       appropriate  libraries were available when libspectrum(3) was compiled,
       than Fuse will try to create UDI images with compressed tracks to  save
       disk space.  There is a .LOG `image' format for debugging purpose. This
       is a plain text file that contains three dumps of the loaded disk image
       at different details.  Not all image formats can store all disk images.
       You cannot save a disk image with an inappropriate  format  that  loses
       some information (e.g. variable track length or sector length).

WEAK DISK DATA
       Some  copy  protections  have  what is described as `weak/random' data.
       Each time the sector is read one or more bytes will change,  the  value
       may  be  random between consecutive reads of the same sector.  Two disk
       image formats (Extended DSK and UDI) can store this type of data.  Fuse
       can read and use weak sector data from EDSK and UDI files when present,
       and can save back weak sector data to UDI image format.

MOVIE RECORDING
       Fuse can save movies with sound in a specific file format (FMF).   This
       recording  is  very  fast, and has a moderate size, but you need to use
       the fmfconv(1) program in fuse-utils(1) to convert into  regular  video
       and/or  audio  files.   The  --movie-compr option allows you to set the
       compression level to None, Lossless or High. If zlib(3) is  not  avail-
       able,  only  None is valid. The default when Zlib is available is Loss-
       less.  Recording a movie may slow down  emulation,  if  you  experience
       performance problems, you can try to set compression to None.

       Fuse records every displayed frame, so by default the recorded file has
       about 50 video frame per second. A standard  video  has  about  24-30/s
       framerate,  so if you set Options/General/Frame rate 1:n or the equiva-
       lent --rate command line option to 2 than recording frame rate  reduces
       about  25/s.  The  exact  frame rate depends on the Z80 clock frequency
       which varies depending on the specific emulated machine.

       Note: You can see all of the "gfx" effects only if the Fuse frame  rate
       option is set to 1, but in most cases you can safely use 2. Also, movie
       recording stops if the emulated machine is changed.

       The recorded sound sampling rate and the channel number is  equal  with
       the  Fuse generated sound sampling rate (44100 Hz by default) and chan-
       nel number (mono by default). The common sampling frequencies in  stan-
       dard  video  files  are  44100 Hz and 48000 Hz. If you use --sound-freq
       command line option you can change the frequency.

       You can record stereo sound if you use  AY  stereo  separation  or  the
       equivalent --separation command line switch.

       You  can  use fmfconv(1) to convert recorded movie file into a standard
       video file.

       Examples

       fuse --movie-start output.fmf --rate 2 --sound-freq 44100  --separation
       ACB

       start video recording about 25/s video frame rate and 44100 Hz sampling
       frequency stereo sound default compression level.

COMPRESSED FILES
       Assuming the appropriate libraries were available  when  libspectrum(3)
       was compiled, snapshots, tape images, dock cartridges and input record-
       ing files (RZX) can  be  read  from  files  compressed  with  bzip2(3),
       gzip(3)  or  zip(3) just as if they were uncompressed. In the zip case,
       only the first supported file  found  inside  the  archive  is  loaded.
       There is currently no support for reading compressed +3, DISCiPLE/+D or
       Beta disk images.

BUGS
       Selecting a startup filter doesn't work properly with  user  interfaces
       other than SDL, Win32 and GTK+.

       Changing  virtual  consoles  when  using  SVGAlib  for joystick support
       causes Fuse to exit. If this  is  a  problem,  compile  Fuse  with  the
       `--disable-ui-joystick' option.

       The poke finder can't search outside `normal' RAM.

       The  libao  file output devices not work properly with the GTK+ UI.  No
       error reporting, but the created file does not contain any sound  data.
       If  you  use a `weak' machine alsa09 makes a lot of clicks and pops and
       will output `ALSA: underrun, at least 0ms.'  error messages.
